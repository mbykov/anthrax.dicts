I have always been ὀψιανθής, a ‘late-bloomer’, and this book is a testament to it.
It began as one of the chapters of my PhD dissertation, submitted to the Univer-
sity of Cambridge in 2005. That thesis addressed topics in dialectal and structural
variation in Ancient Greek compounding, with a focus on epigraphic sources: the
study of verbal compounds was only a small part of the work. If it has taken me ten
years to finally put the word ‘end’ to this research, it is mostly because the topic
of structural variation— which my thesis addressed in a very tentative and inex-
perienced manner—required the kind of attention and in-depth analysis which it
was not possible to provide in one chapter or in a series of articles. And yet, for
all its length, this book is only a ‘chapter’ itself: it focuses on Greek verb-initial
compounds in their interaction with the more pervasive verb-final compounds,
but it leaves out other important topics in the structure of compound types and
their interaction with one another. My hope is that those who read the book and
find it useful may embark on a similar study of other Greek compound categories.
     The stimulus to work on the compounds of Ancient Greek came from my
Cambridge M.Phil. and Ph.D. supervisor, Torsten Meissner, who taught me Myce-
naean Greek and steered my work with matchless patience and good nature: it is
a pleasure to record him first in this long list of acknowledgements. That research
was generously funded by many institutions: I am grateful to the Faculty of Clas-
sics of Cambridge University, the Arts and Humanities Research Board, the Gates
Cambridge Trust, and Pembroke College Cambridge for their financial and mate-
rial support.
     The idea that, in order to understand Greek verb-initial compounds, I had
to compare them to the morphology of verb-final formations materialized one
gloomy afternoon in Cologne, during a stay at the Institut für Linguistik und His-
torisch-Vergleichende Sprachwissenschaft. I thank Prof. Dr. J. L. García Ramón
for the frank talks we had back in 2002. Although he is in no way responsible for
what I have written here, I hope that he will appreciate that I stuck to the task that
seemed so daunting at the time.
     Crucial criticism and eye-opening comments came from my thesis examin-
ers, Jürgen Uhlich and Geoff Horrocks; the latter also provided advice on morpho-
logical matters and very kind support at various points in my career, and so did
James Clackson with his characteristic generosity and directness. My research on
compounding has greatly benefited from talks with Benedicte Nielsen (a fellow
‘compound-addict’), Ollie Simkin (the most knowledgeable and patient person
on earth), Io Manolessou, and Antonietta Bisetto, all of whom have kindly put
their expertise at my disposal.

VIII        Preface and Acknowledgements
     This would have been a very different book had several people and institu-
tions not given me the invaluable opportunity to broaden my understanding of
many fields of Classical studies and Linguistics in the years that followed my
doctorate. In 2005 St John’s College Oxford elected me to the Woodhouse Junior
Research Fellowship, which gave me time and refreshing freedom to explore other
fields of research, including bilingualism, ancient Sicily, comparative religion
and (albeit very briefly!) Lithuanian morphology. In this book I have made use
of some of my published articles which were written during my JRF at St John’s
(Tribulato 2006, 2007 and 2010).
     By appointing me to a temporary lectureship in Philology and Linguistics in
2007 the Faculty of Classics of the University of Cambridge and Pembroke College
Cambridge gave me my first insight into the difficult job of teaching and putting
across my thoughts clearly. My dear friend Laura Rossi enabled me to work as
an editor for a while—an experience which has taught me about writing and
research as well; I am grateful to her for always being on my side throughout
the years. Most recently, Italy’s Ministero dell’Università, dell’Istruzione e della
Ricerca, which elected me to a Rita Levi Montalcini research fellowship in 2010,
has enabled me to learn lots about Greek lexicography, philology and literary dia-
lects whilst enjoying the privilege of living in Venice. Here I have been very lucky
in having the support and affection of Willy Cingano and Caterina Carpinato, who
have helped me find my way in a new place. The Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici
at Ca’ Foscari University has enabled me to test my ideas on language and litera-
ture on their students, who are an integral part of my learning path.
     The preparation of the final manuscript of this book benefited from the
insightful comments of two referees, the revisions of Michael Carroll and Rachel
Barritt Costa, and the careful checks of my heroic assistant, Elisa Criveller; in a
period of great stress, she was a veritable haven of serenity and deserves my most
heart-felt thanks. Serena Pirrotta, Senior Editor at De Gruyter, also made a huge
difference for the final delivery of this project, which she supported from day one
with enthusiasm, competence and patience: working with her and her staff at De
Gruyter has proven a most rewarding experience.
     I have incurred more than one professional and personal debt with Andreas
Willi, who has helped me in several ways throughout the years, and always with
the intellectual generosity and great humanity which are unique to him. Albio
Cesare Cassio has had a huge impact on my development as a scholar and teacher:
his example is a constant source of inspiration.
     In Cambridge and elsewhere Max and Claudia Sternberg, Vito Tagarielli, Jo
Willmott and Marta Zlatić made sure that I had warm food, good friends and a
home no matter where I actually lived. Lucia Prauscello has showered me with
all her kindness, acumen and inexhaustible energy throughout. Without her, I

would have stopped writing this book at several stages: I am profoundly grate-
ful for her friendship. In the final stages of the book, Marta Cardin, Valentina
Copat, Silvia Ferrara, Stefania De Vido and Luca Mondin provided daily cheer
and encouragement. I owe all of them more than I can express in a short sen-
tence—they know how important they have been in these last months.
     However, I would have never been able to work the way I did without the
unfailing and loving support of my extended family and of Sergio in particular,
who has showed me the way in the refined art of συνοίκησις among many other
things. Above all, I wish to thank two great women, Rosalba and Stefania: without
their practical and moral backing, this book would have never happened. I thank
them from the bottom of my heart.

1 Overview
This book provides a study of the diachronic development of compounds with
a verbal first constituent (V1 compounds) in Ancient Greek (AG), with a special
focus on issues of compound orientation. V1 compounds are just one category—
and not even the most prominent one—within the very productive AG compound
system. Compounding is a means of word formation which Greek inherited from
its parent language, Proto-Indo-European (PIE). But while many features of the
Greek compound system are shared with other languages of the IE branch (most
notably Sanskrit), AG introduced significant innovations, reshaping inherited
categories, developing new ones and dooming others to extinction. For these
reasons, AG presents the student of word formation (in Greek, as well as in other
languages) with many challenging and fascinating questions, some of which
have been only sketchily investigated from a modern perspective, if at all.
     The analysis provided in the present book aims to offer a contribution in this
direction. Although the study is chiefly addressed to scholars interested in Greek
language and literature, it also has the ambition of reaching a wider readership of
linguists and of drawing their attention to the many fundamental morphological
questions posed by compounding in AG: a language whose far-reaching impact
on the development of modern European culture is known to all, but which is
becoming increasingly marginalized in modern morphological theory and in
typological language models—as though the antiquity of its attestation made
it merely the relic of an old-fashioned and outdated linguistic past, which we
should now strive to leave behind.1
2 Studying AG V1 compounds: scope and aims
Within the rich AG compound system, the place occupied by V1 compounds is far
from negligible. These formations compound a verbal lexeme (a root or a stem)
1 A relatively recent exception is Lühr (2004), which focuses on some theoretical issues using
the evidence provided by Greek and Sanskrit.

and a nominal one, and are mostly used to indicate agents or instruments. For
instance, the root φερ- of the verb φέρω ‘to carry’ may be compounded with the
stem of the noun οἶκος ‘house’ to form φερέοικος [carry house] ‘one who carries
(his) house (with himself)’, an adjectival agentive compound used in Greek to
refer to the snail (Hesiod), as well as to nomadic peoples (Herodotus). In another
example, κλεψύδρα, the verbal stem κλεψ- ‘steal’ is compounded with the stem
ὑδρ- of the word ὕδωρ ‘water’ to create the instrument noun for the water-clock
(literally, something which ‘steals water’).
     V1 compounds pose specific challenges to morphologists, particularly as
concerns the interface between morphology and syntax, and the impact of syn-
tactic structures (including word order) on the patterns of word formation which
become productive in a given language. The interest aroused by V1 compounds
is visible in most of the many studies on word formation which have appeared
over the last decade: from the Oxford Handbook of Compounding edited by Lieber
and Štekauer (2009a) to the many publications connected to the work of the
Bologna-based Morbo-Comp project or arising from the International Morphol-
ogy Meetings and the Mediterranean Morphology Meetings. A new study of AG V1
compounds has many insights to offer linguists debating the properties of the V1
category cross-linguistically. Moreover, the most recent monographic studies of
AG V1 compounds were published way back in 1946 (Th. Knecht’s Geschichte der
griechischen Komposita vom Typ τερψίμβροτος) and 1978 (Ch. Frei-Lüthy’s Der
Einfluß der griechischen Personennamen auf die Wortbildung). Both these works
are based on methodological premises which have been largely superseded now-
adays, among them a tendency to bypass systematic data-collecting and statistics
in favour of analyses closely focusing on literature (Knecht) or early linguistic
stages (Frei-Lüthy, who does not go beyond Mycenaean and Homeric Greek: for
both, see Chapter 3, section 9).
     Since the question of the origin of the V1 type in PIE is central to its under-
standing in AG, most of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century contributions
addressing V1 compounds also have tended to privilege historical reconstruc-
tion over the systematic study of the V1 category in its diachronic development
within AG (a desideratum which the present monograph aims to fulfil) and of
the morphological and semantic phenomena characterizing AG V1 compounds
as a whole. Combining the methodology of classic philological studies of AG
V1 compounds with that adopted in typological studies of compounding, the
investigation of AG V1 compounds provided in this book aspires to offer a
multi-faceted approach addressing the diachronic dimension (i.e. how V1 com-
pounds developed from the late PIE phase to Mycenaean, Homeric and Classical
and post-Classical Greek) as well as the synchronic dimension (i.e. which verbs
produce V1 compounds and how these are used in specific contexts).

3 AG compound system                   3 Methodology: V1 compounds in the context of the AG compound system
The methodological premise underpinning this study as a whole is that V1 com-
pounds should not be examined in isolation, but in the wider context of the AG
compound system. In Greek, the very existence of the V1 type is surprising, since
its left-oriented structure goes against the right-headed orientation of the com-
pound system. More importantly, V1 compounds have a powerful competitor: the
large class of verb-final (V2) compounds, many of which express the same agen-
tive semantics by combining a nominal first constituent (FC) with a verbal second
constituent (SC). Compounds of this kind are sometimes the exact counterpart of
V1 ones: the adjective οἰκοφόρος ‘carrying the house’, for example, combines the
same lexemes and has the same meaning as φερέοικος, the V1 compound quoted
above.
     The fact that in AG both patterns survive and are productive raises several
questions. Are V1 compounds formed through different processes compared to
V2 compounds? Do V1 compounds express different semantic nuances compared
to their V2 counterparts? Is the productivity of V1 compounds tied to specific
linguistic registers or chronological periods? In other words: are V1 compounds
marked formations that stand in contrast to V2 ones, to be interpreted as the
standard, unmarked ones? Some of these questions have received more attention
than others in past investigations of the AG V1 type. In particular, there has been
a noticeable fascination with issues of style and register, which has produced
works aiming to prove that V1 compounds fulfil different semantics and functions
than V2 ones (e.g. Benveniste 1967). Contributions focusing on the comparative
perspective have also attempted to explain the ‘markedness’ of V1 compounds
by arguing that they reflect the marked word order of the parent language and,
consequently, that they arose to fulfil specific semantic functions, such as the
expression of wishes or orders.2
     My methodological perspective is profoundly different. I do not hold the
investigation of syntactic structures, both in AG and at an earlier stage, to be
unfruitful, but I maintain that this is not the central issue to be investigated by
anyone wishing to understand the productivity of V1 compounds in AG. In order
to explain why these V1 ‘exceptions’ exist and are relatively numerous in a right-
headed language such as Greek, we need to investigate them from the point of
view of their structural and semantic relation to the V2 type. The analysis of each
of the one hundred and fifty-eight V1 compound families collected in the present

study shows that many V1 types were produced as a means to overcome the mor-
phological or structural constraints of the V2 type. Moreover, any understand-
ing of the morphological factors affecting the development and use of a V1 form
alongside or in opposition to a V2 compound must necessarily be based on an
understanding of the morphological behaviour of the base Greek verbs and their
PIE roots, as well as on a deep knowledge of the agentive verbal formations pro-
duced by these verbs, i.e. agent nouns and V2 compounds in -ος (e.g. οἰκοφόρος
‘carrying the house’), -της (e.g. κυνηγέτης ‘dogleader, hunter’) and -ης (e.g. θυμο-
δακής ‘soul-biting’). These methodological premises inform the synchronic anal-
ysis contained in the central section of the present study, Chapters 5 and 6. These
two chapters investigate the formation processes and productivity of V1 com-
pound families, comparing them with the V2 compounds and/or simple agent
nouns produced by the same base verbs. The parallel existence of other left-ori-
ented compound categories in Greek (on which see Chapter 2, section 7) suggests
that V1 compounds were preserved and further developed in Greek precisely to
fill the morphological and semantic gaps left by the pervasive right-oriented type.
The detailed comparison of V1 and V2 compounds provided in Chapter 6 will
show how the low or late productivity of many V2 compound families goes hand
in hand with the relatively high productivity of V1 compounds.
4 The Corpus
As mentioned above, none of the previous investigations of AG V1 compounds
attempt to build a full corpus of forms, since these studies either focus on a
limited timespan (often coinciding with the language of a specific author, usually
from the Archaic or Classical period), or select examples from different centuries,
without an overarching treatment of the development of the V1 type over time.3
      The Corpus provided in the Appendix is the fullest collection of V1 com-
pounds attempted so far. It is based on existing corpora (such as LSJ, Buck-Pe-
tersen, Schwyzer (1939), Tserepis (1902), Waanders (2008) and the LGPN), but
reorganizes their data according to chronological and morphological criteria. For
each verb producing V1 compounds the entry in the Corpus also lists the type(s)
of FC, the appellative compounds (‘appellative’ is a term which simply identifies

as well as any simple agent nouns or V2 formations derived from the same verbs.
All these data have been coordinated by making extensive use of the online TLG,
which enables lemma and substring searches: through these, it has been possible
to search for all derivations from a given root/stem, thus obtaining a compre-
hensive picture of the interaction between V1 compounds, V2 compounds, agent
nouns and other verbal formations from the same roots. Although the present
investigation focuses on AG, which extends between 1400 BC (Mycenaean)
and the end of the sixth century AD, data from Byzantine Greek have also been
included in the Corpus, especially when they provide important insights into the
development of certain compound categories or agent nouns.

assumption underpins the present study: that the comparison between V1 and V2
compounds must take into consideration the prevailing tendencies in the AG com-
pound system (above all, orientation), as well as the development of certain other
compound categories. For this reason, the study of V1 compounds is preceded by
two more general chapters devoted to compounding as a linguistic phenomenon.
     Chapter 1 addresses the theoretical premises that shape compounding as a
universal phenomenon. The need to provide a general chapter of this kind before
embarking on a very technical study of a specific class of AG compounds springs
from the observation that the state of research on compounding in AG is still very
much biased towards the traditional approaches of comparative philology, which
grew out of German nineteenth-century linguistics and are much influenced by
Sanskrit studies. Although numerous contributions tackle individual AG com-
pound categories and their morphological properties from a modern linguistic
perspective, Classical (and more generally comparative) linguists are well aware
that a comprehensive study of compounding in AG and a study of IE compound-
ing from a modern perspective are both yet to be produced.4 This book, which
focuses on one class of compounds in relation to others, is obviously unable to fill
this gap. However, Chapter 1 aims to make a contribution to the way we may think
about AG compounds from a modern perspective, focusing on areas which are
central to the current debate on compounding (headedness, exocentricity, incor-

poration in verbal compounds) and, at the same time, valuable for the study of V1
compounds (see in particular the debate concerning the thorny classification of
the so-called synthetic compounds—or compounds with a verbal SC).
     While this viewpoint is geared towards students of Greek linguistics, the
chapter also pursues the broader aim of making the AG material more accessible
to students of general linguistics. For this reason, the AG forms quoted in this
book are all translated, and basic information that may be redundant for Clas-
sical linguists is included. In particular, Chapter 1 dwells on the peculiarities of
AG compounding (stem compounding, linking elements). These properties are
often overlooked in typological models of compounding, which are overwhelm-
ingly slanted towards non-inflectional languages (English) or on lexeme-based
systems (as Romance is, to some extent).
     Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive overview of all AG compound catego-
ries. This sets the ground for the morphological investigation offered in the book,
while also serving a different purpose: to provide an accessible and at the same
time exhaustive introduction to Greek compound categories for non-Classicists.
The very decision to investigate V1 compounds from a perspective which is first
and foremost morphological and structural, and only secondarily stylistic or lit-
erary, has been made in the hope of providing a useful point of reference for lin-
guists working on V1 compounds in other languages. Those characteristics which
separate V1 compounds from other types, including their contiguity with syntac-
tic structures, are amply discussed in the relevant sections of chapters 1 and 2; the
latter pays special attention to the left-oriented compound categories and their
morpho-syntactic properties.
     Chapters 5 and 6, which exclusively focus on AG, offer other useful insights
into linguistic issues such as the thematic roles fulfilled by AG V1 compounds and
the factors determining their productivity (for instance the need for morpholog-
ical transparency), as well as their interaction with other compound categories
(chiefly synthetic compounds). In this regard, we shall often pay attention to the
great productivity of AG V1 compounds in the onomastic lexicon, a feature which
is well known to those who study V1 compounds in English and Germanic, since
in these languages V1 compounds, an otherwise marginal category, are mostly of
an onomastic nature.
6 Structure (II): The historical perspective
Aside from the issue of the interaction between V1 and V2 formations in a com-
pound system which is particularly rich in verbal compounds, AG V1 compounds
present historical linguists with the more pressing question of their origin. As

                                       6 Structure (II): The historical perspective    7
already mentioned, V1 compounds exist in other IE languages of ancient attes-
tation, ranging from the Indo-Iranian branch (where this type is more produc-
tive) to isolated examples of more difficult interpretation in Latin, Germanic and
Celtic (instances of V1 compounds in Romance and Slavic are briefly discussed
in Chapter 4). This suggests that the V1 type did not arise independently in Greek
and Indo-Iranian but was a feature shared by both, and most probably inherited
from PIE. Indeed, the PIE origin of V1 compounds has been a dominant assump-
tion in studies of IE compounding since the birth of comparative philology. The
comparison between the Greek and Indo-Iranian examples, however, brings out a
number of controversial issues centring around two key questions: first, whether
the Greek V1 type characterized by -si- and synchronically linked to the s-aorist
has its roots in a linguistic stage which precedes Greek itself; and secondly—and
more importantly—whether V1 compounds in PIE were created according to the
principle of stem compounding (the most prevalent form of compounding in AG)
or whether they are early examples of inflectional compounding, arising from
syntactic phrases. This issue, which is related to the debate on the rules of PIE
word formation, also has a huge impact on the way scholars describe the dia-
chronic development of V1 compounds in the early phases of Greek (i.e. Myce-
naean and Homeric Greek) and consequently the mechanisms governing V1 com-
pounds at a synchronic level.
     Since the diachronic perspective is so central to the study of AG V1 com-
pounds, the synchronic analysis provided in Chapters 5 and 6 is preceded by
two chapters which address the historical issues in detail. Chapter 3 looks at the
ways in which AG and ancient IE compounds have been studied over the past
two centuries, and functions as a hinge between the theoretical and structural
issues studied in Chapters 1 and 2 and the analysis of Greek compounds provided
in Chapters 5 and 6 (and to some extent Chapter 4). Far from providing unneces-
sary padding, Chapter 3 examines the roots of certain ways of thinking about V1
compounds which have deeply influenced the subsequent linguistic debate. The
controversies over whether the FC of V1 compounds was originally a noun, an
inflected verbal form or a verbal stem—a small chapter in the history of the early
development of comparative philology—have shaped contemporary interpreta-
tions of Greek V1 compounds. The present investigation does not refrain from
identifying areas of semantic or structural overlap between syntactic phrases and
V1 compounds, an approach which has its roots in the works of scholars from
Jacobi (1897) and Brugmann (1905–1906) down to Benveniste (1967) (all of whom
variously favour the hypothesis of a syntactic origin of the V1 type in PIE) and
which has more recently informed interesting studies on IE phraseology (briefly
sketched in Chapter 6, section 6.3). At the same time, however, the morphological
analysis provided in this book takes a step towards the identification of the FC as

8        Introduction
a verbal root or stem, thus contributing to parallel debates in the field of Romance
linguistics. Different FCs are distinguished by different markers: -e- for stems con-
nected to the thematic present, -si- for stems connected to the s-aorist, -o- for a
variety of thematic stems (some of them going back to nouns). In the long history
of Greek some of these markers clearly evolved into mere linking devices, seman-
tically empty elements which have the function of bridging the transition from
the FC to the SC (Kompositionsfuge) and of ensuring the morphological transpar-
ency of the stem.
     This idea is fully developed in Chapter 4, which provides an investigation
of the prehistory of AG V1 compounds. In order to understand the morphology
of the FC and of its final elements it is necessary to start by studying the early
attestations of the V1 type ending in -ti- in Mycenaean Greek. The uniquely ono-
mastic nature of the Mycenaean V1 compounds and the difficulties inherent in
Linear B spelling conventions require considerable caution as concerns the iden-
tification of linguistic forms and their meaning. The part of Chapter 4 focusing
on Mycenaean and Homeric Greek V1 compounds in -ti- is mostly concerned
with highlighting the factors which contributed to preserving this inherited type
against its transformation into the -si- type. The proposition of Chapter 4 is that
FCs in -ti- were prototypically based on bare roots which found their appointed
verbal formation in the root aorist, as opposed to those based on present stems
(marked by -e-). This hypothesis is presented within a brief overview of the PIE
verbal system which, according to the most authoritative reconstruction, seems
to have been based on a formal, semantic and aspectual opposition between the
present and the aorist.
     The connection of at least one AG V1 category with the aorist is clear: as
already noted, compounds characterized by -si- are synchronically derived from
the stem of the s-aorist and this view is not disputed. The origin of the -si- element
however continues to be debated. An influential explanation maintains that -si-
arises from -ti- through the sound change of assibilation: the corollary of this is
that -si- forms are a uniquely Greek innovation. Scholars who adopt this view
also tend to posit the origin of -ti- compounds in PIE nouns (specifically, action
nouns in -tis) rather than verbs. The question is not easily settled, but Chapter 4
contributes two insights which count against this view: firstly, the fact that—as
just mentioned—many Mycenaean compounds in -ti- may be interpreted as being
connected to simple roots rather than action nouns; and, secondly, the fact that
the proposed structure, with action nouns in the FC, goes against the structural
tendencies of the IE compound system.
     In order to critically assess the traditional ‘action noun hypothesis’, it is
important to pay due attention to the handful of V1 compounds in -ti- attested
in Vedic. The present study is only tangentially interested in the Sanskrit com-

pound system, and the overview of Sanskrit V1 compounds provided in Chapter
4 is necessarily sketchy and dependent on the work carried out by other schol-
ars. However, in section 4.3.2 I consider the view that Vedic -ti- compounds are
affected by specific Vedic-internal and mostly poetic factors (such as rhyming
phenomena and an artificial inversion of the constituent order), which raise the
question of whether Vedic faithfully reflects the PIE situation.
     The picture of AG V1 compounds which emerges from Chapter 4 is that of a
system in swift evolution at the turn of the second millennium BC. Greek inherits
V1 compounds characterized by -e- and -ti- from PIE and perhaps (though this
proposition must necessarily remain speculative) also the category of V1 com-
pounds linked to the s-aorist. While this tripartite system seems to endure in
Mycenaean, the transition to the next linguistic stage, testified by Homeric Greek,
leads to the loss of the -ti- type and to the widespread development of compounds
with FCs in -si-. Compounds in -e- with their subtypes in -o- and -i- (sections 3.1–
3.2) are used throughout AG, but the type in -si- achieves a high level of produc-
tivity, becoming part of a derivational cycle which also includes the s-aorist, the
future, and action nouns in -sis (which appear to have greatly increased from the
fifth century onwards, partly as a consequence of the tendency towards nominali-
zation, section 4.2).
     The historical investigation is particularly useful to correct views about the
productivity and specialization of V1 compounds in Greek and my analysis will
particularly concentrate on individual families which have remained productive
throughout the history of the language. Although I make only sporadic forays into
MG and its compounds, the evolution of the V1 type from Ancient to Medieval
Greek and finally Modern Greek deserves a study in its own right. Works in this
direction (e.g. Andriotis (1938)) have shown that V1 compounds, together with
other left-oriented types of AG, survive throughout Medieval and early Modern
Greek: the perception of them as learned or marginal formations must therefore
be revised in the light of this linguistic continuity.
7 Structure (III): The use of V1 compounds in context
The synchronic analysis provided in Chapters 5 and 6 also aims to offer a sys-
tematic investigation of the contexts in which individual V1 compounds occur.
Part of this investigation obviously concerns literary texts, particularly those of
a poetic nature. The study of the incidence of compounds in relation to literary
style lies at the core of the pioneering monograph by G. Meyer (1923), according
to which the higher or lower frequency of compounds in a given text is connected
to the level of ‘pathos’ of its style. This kind of approach, which investigates the

10         Introduction
use of compounds vis-à-vis stylistics and pragmatics (and not merely because
they are found in a given author or literary genre), has generally not been fol-
lowed by other scholars, with the notable exception of Williger (1928) and da
Costa Ramalho (1952)—the latter having focused on compounds in Aristophanes’
comic style.
     In the analysis of individual V1 compounds, attention will be paid to phe-
nomena of register variation, allusion, and structural artificiality. Previous
studies of Greek V1 compounds have often highlighted these characteristics of
the category, but this approach has also led to the frequent generalization that
V1 compounds are specific to poetry, or indeed almost exclusive to it. It is not
surprising that compounds, including V1 ones, are frequently used in poetic lan-
guage, given its predilection for condensed and allusive modes of expression.
While paying due attention to phenomena which are clearly of a more ‘poetic’ or
‘artificial’ nature, the analysis of Chapters 5 and 6 will also consider the use of V1
compounds in technical prose and in what may justifiably be perceived as ‘stand-
ard language’. Greek literary language also employs compounds which do not
have an especially poetic flavour, which are simultaneously attested in inscrip-
tions and which, therefore, were probably common in the spoken language too.
Obviously, our reconstruction of a ‘common’ or ‘popular’ language is bound to
rely on written documents, almost all of which are standardized: but the fact that
V1 compounds are also attested in non-literary documents is evidence in favour
of their use in ‘standard’ or at any rate less literary language.
     A similar perspective informs the analysis of the role played by V1 com-
pounds in Greek onomastics. It is undeniable that V1 names are an important part
of the Greek onomastic stock. In a way, this is self-evident: since V1 compounds
represent condensed verbal expressions, it is hardly surprising that they prove
popular in the prototypical description of individuals, identified either through
the actions/qualities which their parents wish to associate them with, or those
they habitually perform (the latter being a function specifically tied to nicknam-
ing). Indeed, even in languages in which V1 compounds are not a productive type,
their use as onomastic expressions is high. Yet we should be wary of inferring
information about the remote origin of the V1 type in a given language or even
in the parent language from this state of affairs. The notion that V1 compounds
were prototypically created as onomastic expressions—and thus that they were
endowed with a particular meaning and function (a notion which also affects
the interpretation of their FCs as imperatival or desiderative forms)—is pervasive
in the literature on V1 compounds in PIE and in Greek. The monograph by Frei-
Lüthy (1978) spells this out in its very title: Der Einfluß der griechischen Personen-
namen auf die Wortbildung. However, it is only necessary to go through the collec-
tions of Greek PNs in Bechtel (1917) or in the LGPN to see that V2 compounds are

equally present in the onomastic stock, but this has not led anyone to claim that
the origin of individual categories of V2 compounds in PIE is onomastic.
    The sensible way to look at the interaction between V1 compounds and ono-
mastics is to analyse the mechanisms ruling individual compound families in
order to gain insights into the behaviour of onomastic patterns more generally.
Most V1 names are part of larger groups of formations from the same verbs and
their structure and productivity are almost never independent from those of the
base verb and its other formations. Rather than thinking in terms of an influence
of onomastics on Greek word formation patterns, it may be more fruitful to pay
attention to the considerable impact of ‘general’ (i.e. appellative) word formation
patterns on Greek onomastics. Drawing these threads together, the analysis of
Chapters 5 and 6 aims to contribute towards a better understanding of the use
and semantic specificities of the V1 type in AG.

Chapter One
Compounding and the Classification of
Compounds                 Chapter One – Compounding and the Classification of Compounds
1 Introduction
This chapter provides an overview of the main issues concerning compounding
from a typological point of view and has two aims. The first is to introduce Classi-
cists to concepts which are useful for the analysis of Greek compound categories
and to the topics which are most vigorously debated in current morphological
research. This is a particularly urgent requirement in Classical studies, since
available accounts of Greek compounding usually adopt a traditional framework,
which largely disregards the methodologies developed by modern linguists. In
particular, this chapter clears the ground regarding the definition of compound-
hood, the spelling of compounds, the analysis of accentual patterns, the study
of headedness and the distinction between exocentricity and endocentricity,
thereby setting the stage for the classification of AG compound categories pro-
vided in Chapter 2.
     Since a study of AG compounding within a modern framework remains a
desideratum, the second aim of this chapter is to make the defining characteris-
tics of AG compounding better known to linguists who work on modern languag-
es.1 It may come as a surprise that in the recent Oxford Handbook of Compounding
edited by Lieber and Štekauer (2009a) there are no chapters focusing on individ-
ual ancient IE languages and even the diachronic overview by Kastovsky (2009)
has some notable omissions.2 With this in view, the present chapter dwells on
those elements which characterize compounding in Greek vs. compounding in
English (the use of stems, the presence of a linking vowel at the end of the FC),
as well as on general areas of interest (writing and accentuation patterns, the
orientation of compounds).
1 Lühr (2004) is a step in this direction, but does not cover all areas of interest.
2 In considering the early syntactic approaches to IE compounding—with a strong bias towards
Jacobi (1897)—Kastovsky (2009) does not address compound orientation. Also omitted is a
discussion of accentual patterns, except for the difference between prefixed verbs and their
derivations. An overview of the diachronic development of certain compound categories (e.g. [N
N] compounds) would also have been welcome, particularly since some of these categories have
become very productive in later chronological stages of IE.

14          Chapter One – Compounding and the Classiication of Compounds
2 Compounds and compounding
By its most basic definition, a compound is a word formed by two or more lexemes
(e.g. girlfriend) or lexical stems (e.g. Francophile). The morphological process
through which a compound is created is called compounding (‘nominal compo-
sition’, nominale Komposition or, simply, Komposition are more common terms in
Classical linguistics).3 The kind of compounding studied in this book and intro-
duced in this chapter does not involve forms combining a prefix and a verbal
basis (English type overlook, AG ἐπιγράφω ‘write over, incise’), nominals derived
from them (e.g. overlooking, AG ἐπιγραφή ‘inscription’) or the combination of two
verbs (English type sleep-walk, MG type τρωγοπίνω [eat drink] ‘eat and drink’),
which is unattested in AG.4
     Compounding is a widely exploited type of word formation cross-linguisti-
cally, which has been studied from a wide range of methodological perspectives.
In recent decades the study of compounds and their classification has seen the
English language attain a particular prominence. This is the consequence of
two facts: the high productivity of compounds in English, which has prompted
in-depth studies of their characteristics; and the development of new linguistic
approaches in English-speaking countries. As a result, the bulk of bibliography
on compounding has, as a sine qua non, always engaged with English and its
compound categories. Although this has favoured the use of a largely shared ter-
minology on the part of linguists belonging to different schools, it has also caused
some disadvantages. This chapter focuses on some elements of tension between
current approaches to compounding and the approaches and traditional termi-
nology used in the study of ancient IE languages, and AG in particular.
3 The definition of compounds
The previous section began with a basic definition of what a compound is, which
non-experts may consider satisfactory. Yet we need only browse a number of
introductions to compounding to realize that the status of compound (‘com-
poundhood’ in linguistic jargon) is a hotly debated topic, perhaps the very heart
of the disputes between linguists of different credos.
     Let us start from a simple definition:
     A compound is a word which consists of two or more words.
     Fabb (1998: 66).
3 On terminology in IE linguistics, see too Lindner (2011: 4–6).

                                                     3 The deinition of compounds           15
This description of compounds, which is provided in a general introduction to
compounding in a general handbook of morphology, echoes the following classic
definition of English compounding:
      When two or more words are combined into a morphological unit, we speak of a compound.
      Marchand (1969: 11).
Both definitions can be criticized from two angles. First, they assume that the
concept of ‘word’ does not require any further definition. Secondly, they ignore
the problem that a large number of compounds result from the joining of ele-
ments which do not occur as independent words in the lexicon of a given lan-
guage. Although this is a problem of minor importance in English (the language
to which these definitions apply), we can appreciate its relevance by considering
an English word such as Gallophile: neither member of this compound is an inde-
pendent word in English.
      An alternative definition may thus prove to be more accurate and unambig-
uous:
      Compounding is the process through which a compound lexeme is derived from two or
      more simpler lexemes.
      Matthews (1991: 83).
In this case, the problematic term word is replaced by the technical term lexeme.
This substitution brings some advantages.5 For instance, it allows for the pres-
ence of constituents which are not entire words, but simple or complex stems,
i.e. ‘uninflected parts of independent words that do not themselves constitute
independent words’.6 A large number of languages use stems in compounding:
Greek, both Ancient and Modern, is prominent among them. In our example, Gal-
lophile ‘lover of French culture’, both constituents can be analysed as Neoclassi-
cal simple stems. In its derivation Gallophilia ‘love of French culture’, the lexeme
-philia is a complex stem: it is formed by the simple stem phil- ‘love’, followed by
the morphological suffix -ia, which is specialized for the derivation of feminine
nouns.
      Not all linguists will agree with this view. Radical morphologists may contest
that, from the point of view of English, Gallo- is a prefix and -phile is a suffix:
Gallophile therefore is not a compound, but a derivation. Such analyses look at
the status of constituents from a synchronic point of view, aside from their histor-

ical origin. Yet it has equally been noted that the exclusion of Neoclassical forms
such as Gallophile from compounding is unsatisfactory precisely on synchronic
grounds, since these forms share many characteristics with native compound
patterns and are usually granted compound-status by native speakers.7 Consider
for instance the now pervasive term gastropub, a form which combines a Neoclas-
sical stem (gastro-) with a common English word (pub) to identify a pub serving
restaurant-like food. Again, grammars treat gastro- as a prefix, but most speakers
who know the Neoclassical word gastronomy would conclude that gastropub is
nothing else than a compound.
     These examples show not only that theoretical definitions of compounds can
differ considerably, but also that the interpretation of individual forms is a matter
of debate. As a consequence, much work has been devoted to the study of other
interpretative approaches, with the aim of reaching a more problem-free definition.
3.1 Defining criteria: spelling, accent, inflectional markers
In order to circumvent some of the problems inherent in classifications of com-
pounds which are based solely on the morphological description of the constit-
uents, other approaches focus on criteria as diverse as spelling, phonetics (par-
ticularly accent), semantics, internal syntax and lexicalization. Some of these
criteria are easily criticized, especially if they aspire to be universal. For instance,
spelling (i.e. the writing of compounds as one graphic unit, with or without inter-
nal hyphens) is not a sound criterion for English, where the orthography of com-
pounds is notoriously variable and where even the same form may be spelled
differently. A case in point is the spelling of one of the terms with which this
book is concerned: both word formation and word-formation are used in the lit-
erature, and both forms are considered compounds. Other provisos may apply to
languages whose orthography and writing traditions differ from those of mod-
ern-day Europe, and we will return to this point apropos of AG in section 4.4.
     Similarly, the so-called ‘stress test’, widely applied for the identification of
compoundhood in English, is not uncontroversial. In its basic formulation, the
stress test assumes that the accentual pattern of compounds is different from
7 Bauer (2003: 46), Kastovsky (2009: 326). The issue of the classification of Neoclassical com-
pounds is much debated, as is the question of the classification of its constituent elements. For
in-depth discussion, see Marchand (1969: 132, 218) Bauer (1998), Petropoulou and ten Hacken
(2002), Lieber (2009b: 364). Scalise and Bisetto (2009: 47), in my opinion rightly, conclude that
Neoclassical compounds ‘are generally encompassed in the subordinated class [...] The use of the
neoclassical label therefore is only a means for describing the kind of constituent that is used’.

that of phrases and predicts that proper compounds will bear only one accent,
usually on the left-hand element. The classic examples adduced in this case are
blackbird ([ˈblækbɜː(r)d]), a compound which indicates a specific bird, belong-
ing to the Turdus genus, vs. black bird ([ˈblæk ˈbɜː(r)d]), a phrase indicating any
type of black bird.8 However, mono-accentuation alone cannot be considered an
infallible criterion for compoundhood either, since both constituents may pre-
serve their original accentuation (word-formation [ˈwɜː(r)d fɔː(r)ˈmeɪʃ(ə)n]) or one
of them may acquire a secondary stress for emphasis (as in man-made [ˈmæn
ˈmeɪd]).9 When we turn to AG, any consideration concerning accent must take
into account writing practices and the transmission of texts, as we will see shortly
in section 4.3.
     Another criterion, again developed for English, looks at the way inflectional
markers are placed within compounds. It predicts that these markers will only
be placed in the head of compounds, which for the time being we may define as
its leading constituent: this is the so-called ‘isolation rule’ (or ‘inseparability’ /
‘lack of modification’ of the FC). If a given form receives inflectional markers in its
non-head, it is probably not a compound. Black cat may be changed into blacker
cat, but the compound blackbird has no form such as **blackerbird, because the
isolation rule predicts that comparative suffixation, as is the case here, can only
occur in the head (which is bird).10 Consider a further example, the sequence
student book. If it is a compound, this sequence will receive the plural ending
on its head, giving us student books. If, on the other hand, the sequence takes
inflectional markers in its non-head, as in the form students’ books, it is not a
compound, but a phrase referring to the books owned by individual students.
     It is useful to note that tests such as the ‘isolation rule’ have their source in
the fact that, typically, English compounding involves a large number of what
morphologists call ‘syntactic compounds’ and which the uninitiated may simply
describe in terms of being ‘more than one word’: word formation and student book
are two examples of syntactic compounds. The isolation rule and the stress test
are applied precisely to distinguish English syntactic compounds from mere noun
phrases. The isolation rule too falls short as a criterion, however, since the results
which it produces are frequently doubtful. Consider for instance the sequence
women’s literature. The presence of number marking and inflectional ending in
its non-head women’s goes against the isolation rule; moreover, the sequence has
two stresses. Yet semantics and lexicalization encourage us to treat this phrase as

cerns AG, section 6.4 will consider the case of forms displaying an inflected FC:
under discussion will be the question whether and to what extent it may be useful
to speak of univerbations in these cases, and we will also take the opportunity to
note that, crucially, in AG some linking elements look like inflectional endings, a
phenomenon which does not occur in English.
4 Ancient Greek compounding as stem compounding
Unlike the Sanskrit grammarians (see section 9.1), ancient Greek scholars did not
devote a lot of attention to the definition of compounds. They contented them-
selves with distinguishing compounding proper (σύνθεσις, with its derivation
σύνθετον ‘compound’) from the process of juxtaposition (παράθεσις: essentially
forms with an inflected FC, παράθετα), and the extant sources do not offer any
form of theorization.11 The first characteristic that distinguishes Greek com-
pounds from those of many other languages, particularly English, is that the
usual basic definition ‘a compound is the joining of two or more words’ does not
apply.12 Greek compounds typically involve a FC that does not correspond to a
full ‘word’ but to a stem, and a SC which may consist of either a stem or an inde-
pendently attested word, but which usually displays special derivational suffixes
when used in compounding.
     While the English compound classroom can be described as being composed
of two words, it is more problematic to say the same of the Greek compound
κουροτρόφος lit. ‘young men-nurturer’, i.e. ‘nurturer of young men’, and even
more so of the form βουπλήξ ‘ox-goad’. In κουροτρόφος the FC κουρο- corre-
sponds to a stem, not to a full ‘word’, which in its nominative singular is κοῦρος
‘boy’ (κόρος in the Attic dialect); the SC, -τρόφος, corresponds to the autono-
mous word τροφός ‘nurse’, but we should note, in the first place, that the com-
pound does not retain the accent of the simplex. In βουπλήξ the FC βου- is a stem,
corresponding to no autonomous form of the word βοῦς ‘ox’; the SC consists of
the verbal root πληγ- (the same on which the derived present πλήσσω ‘strike’ is
based), which in the nominative singular is followed by the inflectional suffix -ς
11 Debrunner (1917: 17), Lindner (2011: 6). This may be due to the loss of pre-Imperial Greek
grammar, but even later grammarians show little interest in definition: Herodian for instance
discusses several examples of compounds (e.g. 3.2.35.11–14, 3.2.47.20–21 Lentz), but always in
connection with individual literary passages or accentuation rules. For the definition in Dionysi-
us Thrax’ Grammar, see Lindner (2011: 29).

(yielding -πληξ). The literature classifies βουπλήξ as a ‘verbal root compound’
on account of the fact that the stem or noun contained in the SC lacks an overt
derivational morpheme (Chapter 2, section 6.1). The general principle that can be
derived from these examples is that, on the whole, Greek compounding is stem
compounding. In its basic definition, a stem is
     a word-class-specific lexeme representation stripped of any inflectional endings, which has
     to combine with additional derivational and/or inflectional morphemes in order to function
     as a word.
     Kastovsky (2009: 324).
According to Ralli (2009: 457), the use of stems rather than words is connected
to the fact that certain languages, including Greek, have stem-based inflectional
morphology: the exclusion of inflectional or derivational markers from the FC
would appear to be the defining characteristic of compounding in these lan-
guages. Far from forming systematic categories, Greek compounds with inflected
FCs are exceptional cases, and their syntactic origin (however remote) is easy to
prove. The question also has important consequences for the analysis of Greek
V1 compounds. In Chapter 2, section 7.5.4, and Chapter 4, the idea that the FCs
of such compounds represent old inflected forms is criticized: going in the same
direction as current analyses of [V N] compounds in Romance and other lan-
guages, I maintain that the FCs of Greek V1 compounds contain roots or stems, to
which compound markers may be attached. The morphological criteria behind V1
compounds therefore follow the general properties of Greek compounding.
     With regard to the nature of the SCs, as already noted, it is possible to dis-
tinguish between compounds in which the SC corresponds to an autonomous
word (the case of κουροτρόφος vs. τροφός) and compounds in which the SC is
a bound form (the case of βουπλήξ).13 However, our capacity to draw such a dis-
tinction attenuates considerably when our focus is on a language which is no
longer spoken. Any conclusion drawn from AG depends on the state of the doc-
umentation and may be overturned by the discovery of new texts or by a fresh
analysis of familiar ones. Some AG autonomous words are attested suspiciously
late in comparison to their compound forms, and historical linguists are often
led to conclude that some simplicia are back-formations from compounds. For
instance, simple s-stem adjectives in -ής such as ψευδής ‘false’ derive from the
very common class of s-stem compounded adjectives in -ής (Chapter 2, section 6.2);
13 Describing MG compounds, which continue Classical types albeit with a high degree of
simplification, Ralli (2009: 456) similarly concludes that ‘[Stem Stem] and [Stem Word] are the
two possible structures of most Greek compounds’.

20          Chapter One – Compounding and the Classiication of Compounds
while agent nouns in -της (Chapter 2, section 6.4) are thought to arise from their
compounded counterparts. Depending on how the relation between compounds
and simplicia is judged, the interpretation of these two compound classes changes
considerably, with consequences for our understanding of AG compounding as
whole.14
     Another category that linguists often debate is the productive type of verbal
compounds ending in -ος, of which κουροτρόφος is representative. This cate-
gory displays both SCs that correspond to autonomous words (as κουροτρόφος)
and SCs which do not, among which two common subgroups are those in -ποιός
‘maker’ and -ουργός ‘worker’. There is, therefore, no consensus as to the origi-
nal status of this category: are they prototypically compounds, from which later
simplicia derive as back-formations? Or are they the compound forms of autono-
mous words? The fact that the accent of the compounds is usually different from
that of the simplicia is often used as proof that these formations ought not to be
treated as [N N] compounds. We will return to this issue in section 9.2 and Chapter
2, section 6.3.2.
4.1 A typical morphophonological feature: the linking vowel
The FC of Greek compounds can be an adverb (e.g. εὐ- ‘well’), a preposition (e.g.
ἐν- ‘in’), a nominal stem (e.g. κουρο- ‘young man’) or a verbal stem (e.g. φερε-
‘bring’: on the interpretation of such stems, see Chapter 4, sections 3 and 6.1).
An ambiguous case is represented by the so-called particles (e.g. ἀ(ν)- ‘without’,
δυσ- ‘badly’). Classic accounts of AG compounding rank them among compound
constituents, but since these particles do not occur as autonomous words in the
language, it remains an open question whether, from the point of view of morpho-
logical theory, formations like ἄμορφος ‘without form’ and δύσμορος ‘ill-fated’
should not be considered derivations rather than compounds.
     When adverbs and prepositions feature in compounds their formal appear-
ance is the same as when they are used as autonomous words, but nominal and
verbal FCs are usually represented as bare stems. The most common stems end in
-ο- or -ᾱ-/-η-, -ι- and -υ-: these stems derive from either a root provided with a der-
ivational suffix (the most common of which are -ο- and -ᾱ-/-η-), or from vocalic
stems, as in examples (1a–d) below:

15 The Greek first declension is characterized by two types of suffixes: -ā (ᾱ), which in the At-
tic-Ionic dialect (and later in Koine Greek) yields -ē (η); and -ă (ᾰ) < *-jă.
16 Third-declension s-stem neuter nouns (type ἔπος, γένος) are formed with the ablauting suffix
-es-/-os-, whose modifications are linked to the inflectional paradigm of s-stems nouns in PIE: in
Greek, -οσ- characterizes the direct cases of the singular, while -εσ- (usually not kept in this form
through loss of intervocalic [s], resulting in hiatus and contraction) characterizes all other cases.

22          Chapter One – Compounding and the Classiication of Compounds
In practice, though, this distribution is perturbed in Greek by the intervention of
analogy, often responding to needs of morphological transparency or phonologi-
cal convenience. The most common phenomenon is the spread of -o- from FCs of
the second declension to other stems, as in (3a) and (3b):17
(3)
a. Noun:              πῦρ ‘fire’
     Stem:            πυρ-
     FC: πυρ-ο-
     Compound: πυροβόλος ‘fire-darting’
b. Noun:              ὕλη ‘wood cut down’
     Stem:            ὑλ- (root) + -η- (suffix)
     FC: ὑλ-ο-
     Compound: ὑλοτόμος ‘woodcutter’.
Synchronically, πυροβόλος and other third-declension consonantal FCs look as if
they have derived from the genitive singular (-ος) and this formal similarity may
perhaps be behind the spread of -ο- to these stems:
(4)
a. Noun:              ἀσπίς ‘shield’
     Stem:            ἀσπιδ-
     FC: ἀσπιδ-ο- (cf. the gen. sg. ἀσπίδος)
     Compound: ἀσπιδοφόρος ‘shield-bearing’.
b. Noun:              κύων ‘dog’
     Stem:            κυν-
     FC: κυνο- (cf. the gen. sg. κυνός)
     Compound: κυνοκλόπος ‘dog-stealer’.
In (4a–b), -ο- is a semantically empty element, whose morpho-phonological func-
tion is limited to providing a bridge between the constituents: it does not signify
gender, number or case. With the passing of time, -ο- became the only linking
vowel in Greek, an element which according to Ralli (2009: 455) signifies com-
poundhood itself in MG: ‘items such as this -o- constitute markers, the primary
function of which is to indicate the process of compound formation’. Ralli further
17 See Lindner (2011: 45). In diachronic terms, the use of -ο- in first-declension nouns may be
interpreted as a relic from the stage when the ancestors of feminine nouns belonged to the the-
matic declension, being a type of thematic collective. However, in Greek the spread of -ο- to
individual first-declension forms seems to be ruled by analogy.

argues that the obligatory presence of such marking is to be explained by the
inflectional richness of Greek and the fact that its compounds are stem-based: in
languages with no inflection, or where compounding is mostly based on lexemes
which occur independently, this marking is not needed.18
      In AG, compound markers of this kind were originally much more numer-
ous than the -o- which has survived into MG. Just as in the case of -o-, vocalic
elements originally belonging to stems were detached from them and used as
linking vowels.19 For instance, -ι- is originally at home in three types of FCs: those
from i-stem nouns, as in (2a); those from s-stem nouns belonging to the ‘Caland
system’, such as καλλι- from κάλλος ‘beauty’;20 and those in which -ι- is the relic
of an old dative (e.g. δουρικλυτός ‘spear-famous’, probably deriving from the
phrase δουρὶ κλυτός ‘famous for the spear’). From these prototypical categories,
-ι- spread to other FCs, where its function was restricted to that of a mere linking
element. We can see this clearly in the development of compounds with the FC
πυρι- as opposed to πυρ-, as in (1a), or πυρο-, as in (3a), and, more importantly,
in V1 compounds of the types τερψίμβροτος ‘delighting men’ and βωτιάνειρα
‘feeding men’, where -ι- is not part of a stem or root and is devoid of any meaning:
it may have been imported into this category by analogy with other classes.21
      Even -η- was extended from Attic-Ionic first-declension constituents, such as
those in (1b), to other types of stems: see for instance ἐλαφηβόλος ‘deer-shoot-
ing’ vs. ἔλαφος ‘deer’ and θαλαμηπόλος ‘bedchamber maid’ vs. θάλαμος ‘bed-
chamber’. These early examples feature in the language of the Homeric poems
and are most probably influenced by the metre, since the expected ἐλαφoβόλος
and θαλαμoπόλος, with their sequences of more than two light internal syllables,
would not fit the hexameter. The FC may therefore employ a linking vowel accord-
ing to the morpho-phonological features of the compound and to the needs of the
texts in which it is used. Vocalic stems in -υ- and -αυ- are much rarer than those
in -ο-, -ᾱ-/-η- and -ι-.
18 Ralli (2008b), Ralli (2009: 455).
19 Other accounts speak of ‘compound markers’ or ‘interfixes’. For such interfixes in early IE,
see Lindner (2011: 52).
20 The so-called ‘Caland system’ concerns, among other elements, FCs deriving from adjectives
in -ρός or those s-stem neuters in -ος which correspond to comparatives in -ιων and superlatives
in -ιστος (e.g. κάλλος with καλλίων, κάλλιστος). In these FCs, the suffixes -ρός and -oσ-/-εσ- are
replaced by -ι-: in all appearances, this vowel is a linking element. For a basic introduction to
this aspect of the Caland system, see Risch (1974: 218–219), Meissner (2006: 14–16), Rau (2009:
67–77), Lindner (2011: 62–70).
21 For a full analysis of this series of developments, see Chapter 4, sections 3.2, 4 and 6.1. See
also Lindner (2011: 69–70), particularly for the hypothesis that some of these FCs may derive from
old verbal nouns.

24           Chapter One – Compounding and the Classiication of Compounds
      Many compounds whose FC is a verbal stem feature -ε- at the end of the FC: this
most probably derives from the thematic vowel, which may be attached to roots
(e.g. φερ-) to form the stem of the thematic present (φερ-ε/o-). It is more prob-
lematic to infer from this that the FC of φερέοικος compounds was an inflected
verbal form—for instance the present imperative φέρε ‘carry!’—from which the
compounds would have derived by way of univerbation.22 There are many prob-
lems with this hypothesis. Most accounts do not clarify whether or not in the indi-
vidual Greek specimina this -ε- is still endowed with syntactic and semantic func-
tions (most notably the expression of time and verbal number). Also, the Greek
forms are clearly not univerbations any longer: for the sake of the argument, even
if the remote source of φερέοικος were the phrase φέρε οἶκον ‘carry the house!’,
the fact remains that the resulting compound contains the adjectival suffix -ος
and has therefore undergone a process of derivation (on the role of these suffixes,
especially in exocentric compounds, see Chapter 2, section 5.1). It may be safer to
assume that φερε- and comparable FCs are composed present stems in which -ε-
derives from the thematic vowel but does not have a semantic function (Chapter
4, sections 3 and 6.1). The verbal semantics of the FC is expressed by the verbal
stem as a whole.
4.2 Vocalic encounters: hiatus, elision, contraction and lengthening
Because of the spread of linking elements, the majority of AG FCs end in a vowel,
even when the stem from which they derive is consonantal. This poses special
problems when the SC itself begins with a vowel, as AG tends to not tolerate
vocalic hiatus.23 There are four possibilities in this case:
(1) The hiatus is preserved: examples include compounds in -οεργός, in which -ο-
is the linking element and -εργός is the SC meaning ‘worker’; or ἄωρος ‘untimely’,
in which the negative prefix ἀ- encounters the SC derived from ὥρα ‘time’. Hia-
tuses of this kind often conceal older stages in which the SC began with pho-
nemes later lost in Classical Greek: [w], as in ϝεργ- ‘work’ yielding -εργός, and [h]
(< *s- or *j-), as in ὥρα ‘time’ (< *j-). In some varieties of Classical Greek (includ-

ing Attic) the initial aspiration of the SC -ωρος may also have been pronounced
word-internally (the phenomenon known as ‘interaspiration’), but in most other
varieties it was probably lost at an early stage (and even in Attic internal [h] is
likely to have been articulated very feebly).
(2) The linking vowel is elided: see e.g. φιλάνθρωπος ‘loving mankind’ < *φιλo-
ανθρωπος vs. φιλό‐σοφος ‘loving wisdom’.
(3) The two vowels are contracted: this solution is taken in many compounds
in -ο-oργός, whose contracted version is -ουργός. Similarly, compounds in
-ουχος ‘having’ derive from -ο-οχος, in which -o- is the linking element, while
-οχος derives from ἔχω ‘to have’. These contractions usually replace the hiatuses
created by the conditions described under (1).
(4) There is no linking element and the initial vowel of the SC is lengthened rather
than elided or regularly contracted. Examples include:
– στρατ̄γός ‘army leader’ vs. ἄγω (expected situations **στρατᾰγός or
     **στρατωγός).
– ἱππήλατος ‘driven by horses’ vs. ἑλάω ‘drive’ (expected situations **ἱππ-
     έλατος or **ἱππούλατος);
– ὁμώνυμος ‘having the same name’ vs. ὄνομα ‘name’ (expected situations
     **ὁμόνυμος or ** ὁμoύνυμος).
The phenomenon described in (4) is known among Indo-Europeanists as ‘Wacker-
nagel’s lengthening’, since it was first explained by J. Wackernagel.24 The length-
ened vowels in question have been traditionally viewed as the result of special
ancient ‘contractions’: they cannot be regular contractions as the resulting long
vowel is always wrong.25 The phenomenon is now viewed as a kind of compensa-
tory lengthening triggered by the loss of the IE laryngeals in Greek, which colour
and lengthen the preceding vowel.26 Thus, -ᾱγός shows reflexes of the initial *h2
of ἄγω, -ηλατος of the initial *h1 of ἑλάω and -ώνυμος of the initial *h3 of ὄνομα.27
Classical Greek extended or ignored this type of lengthening largely according
24 Wackernagel (1889).
25 See e.g. Debrunner (1917: 59).
26 Beekes (1971), Meier-Brügger (1992a: 38). The classic account of the development of the IE
laryngeals in Greek is Beekes (1969). For a short overview, see Rix (1992: 36–39). For laryngeals in
IE Kompositionsfuge, see Lindner (2011: 52–61).
27 -ᾱγός is always quoted as the classic example of the reflexes of *h2 in Kompositionsfuge, but
the [a:] is probably the result of analogy, since the sequence *-o-h2- is expected to yield [ɔ:] (ω) in
Greek: see Lindner (2011: 54 n. 28) for a discussion.

sequence of too many light syllables.
4.3 Phonological features: accent
In the Greek texts printed in modern editions, all the forms identifiable as com-
pounds show only one accent which, in keeping with the rules of Greek accentu-
ation, falls on one of the last three syllables: this corresponds to the situation in
MG.28 In principle, however, there is no certainty that these texts faithfully repre-
sent the situation in spoken Greek, an issue that is also relevant to the spelling of
compounds. First, the diacritics for marking accent are a Hellenistic invention, but
most manuscripts omit to use them regularly until the seventh century AD. More
importantly for our purposes, AG also applies monoaccentuation to sequences
of two or three ‘words’ which form a unit in accentual terms. In this case, Greek
grammars distinguish between the ‘enclitic accent’, when a word loses its accent
and is joined to the preceding one from the point of view of accentuation (e.g. καί
μιν ‘and him’) and ‘proclitic’ accent, when a word loses its accent and is joined to
the following one from the point of view of accentuation (e.g. ἐκ κεφαλῆς ‘from
the head’). Moreover, in some archaic texts word division is represented in a dif-
ferent way from later texts and the guiding principle is clearly accent: punctua-
tion, when used, tends to mark off accentual units rather than ‘words’.29 These
examples show that inferring the status not only of the notion of ‘compound’ but
also of that of ‘word’ from accent is highly problematic in AG and caution should
be exercised when accent is used as a test to determine compoundhood.30
     Modern texts are often edited in view of the practical rules described by the
AG grammarians, chiefly Aristophanes of Byzantium, Aristarchus and Herodi-
an.31 Even these instructions betray a high degree of variation, however, and this
prompted Vendryès (1945: 188) to conclude that incoherence is more frequent
than regularity. Keeping this in mind, we may note that the following phenomena
are typical of those lexical units identifiable as compounds:
28 Ralli (2013: 79–84).
29 See e.g. the Linear B example e-ke-de-mi, corresponding to ἔχει δέ μιν ‘and he has him/it’.
Archaic inscriptions sporadically confirm that enclitics and proclitics were not marked as inde-
pendent units: see for instance hοπαις : καλος : ναι (Attic vase): ‘The boy : (is) fine : yes’, where
the article ὁ is considered part of the following word. Further examples are discussed by Mor-
purgo Davies (1987).

(1) When the SC corresponds to an autonomous word, the accent of the com-
pound will often be different from that of the autonomous word: the compound,
that is, behaves as a new lexical unit, to which the general Greek accentuation
rules apply.32 Thus, although ἀκρόπολις ‘high city’ is arguably a type of πόλις
‘city’, its accent nevertheless moves to the antepenultimate syllable (this is possi-
ble because the last syllable is light).
(2) In some well-defined categories of compounds, the accent can go against the
general rules of Greek. For instance, while passive V2 compounds of the type
ὀρεσίτροφος ‘reared on mountains’ (Chapter 2, section 6.3) follow the trisyllabic
rule (acute accent may go on the penultimate or antepenultimate syllable if the
last one is light), their active counterparts, formed with the same type of SC,
tend to keep the accent on the penultimate syllable: thus κουροτρόφος against
**κουρότροφος, which would be equally possible.33 This accentual opposition is
fundamental to the distinction between the passive and the active understanding
of the SC (-τροφος) and is generally consistent (see too Chapter 2, section 6.3.1).
(3) In s-stem compound adjectives in -ης, the accent falls mostly on the last sylla-
ble, where it tends to be acute if the antepenultimate is light (εὐγενής ‘well-born’),
but may also be circumflex, usually if the SC contains an old contraction (thus
Περικλῆς < Περικλέϝης). If the antepenultimate syllable is heavy, however, the
accent tends to be paroxytone (e.g. θρασυμήδης ‘bold of plan’).34 As Περικλέϝης
shows, this retraction of the accent also affects compounds with light antepenul-
timate syllable when they are used as PNs: compare the name Διογένης vs. the
adjective διογενής ‘born of Zeus’.
Other rules, concerning specific sub-classes, are listed in Debrunner (1917: 77–79)
and Vendryès (1945: 189–199); we will return to some of them in the context of the
classification of AG compounds in Chapter 2.
32 This still holds in MG: see Ralli (2009: 456–457).
33 As a matter of fact, the original position of the accents in these compounds seems to have been
on the last syllable, as for instance in συφορβός, as is suggested by the parallels in Sanskrit (e.g.
go-ghan-á- ‘oxen-killing’). By the so-called Wheeler’s Law, in oxytone dactylic words the accent
moves from the last to the penultimate syllable: thus **βουληφορός (compare φορός ‘bringing,
productive’) becomes βουληφόρος ‘counsel-bringing’. This shift is also extended to compounds
that do not have a dactylic rhythm, so that we have κουροτρόφος instead of **κουροτροφός. A
number of exceptions apply: in particular, the accentuation of active V2 compounds such as
ἱππόδαμος ‘horse-taming’, which Vendryès (1945: 193) defines ‘inexpliquée’, may derive from
bahuvrihis: see further Chapter 2, section 6.3.1.

4.4 Writing of Greek compounds
In section 3.1 we saw that the way in which compounds are written is not a helpful
criterion for distinguishing English proper compounds from syntactic phrases
on account of the lack of a fixed orthographic rule. In AG and other languages
of ancient attestation we face two additional practical issues: the orthographic
rules in use at the time when a given compound entered the text, and the trans-
mission of the text itself. As noted above, in addition to being written mostly in
capitals and without diacritical marks for a large part of its history, AG was also
usually written in scriptio continua, i.e. without word separators. The epigraphic
texts which do use word separators are rare enough to constitute a self-contained
group, which means that scholars are unable to derive detailed rules about the
perception of compounding vs. syntactic phrases. A notable exception are the
second-millennium Mycenaean Linear B tablets, which make systematic use of
word separators, but even in this case issues of detail remain unclear: see for
instance the discussion of the apparently two-word compound ke-re-si-jo we-ke
‘Cretan-made’ (in which the word separator is usually taken to be a mistake) in
Chapter 6, section 4.1.
     Rather than external appearance, the real differentiating criterion for com-
poundhood in AG is to be found in the fact that the inflectional nature of the lan-
guage allows for an automatic distinction of syntactic phrases from compounds.
In phrases, the relation between the constituents is made clear by inflectional
markers, as in κούρου τροφός ‘nurturer of the child’. In compounds, by con-
trast, the inflectional elements with the responsibility of indicating the relation
between the constituents are lost, as in κουροτρόφος ‘rearing children’. The dif-
ference between the two forms is therefore morphological, not graphic. To take
another compound class, the difference between a prepositional phrase and a
prepositional compound is usually evident from the fact that in the phrase the
noun governed by the preposition is inflected in the case-form required by the
preposition (e.g. ἐν κεφαλῇ ‘inside the head’), whereas the compound is marked
by the derivational suffix -ος (sometimes also -ιος) in place of the governed case:
ἐγκέφαλος ‘within the head’ > ‘brain’.35
     AG still contains a number of ambiguous cases, however. Consider the
Homeric adjective κορυθαιόλος ‘with glancing helmet’ (discussed in Chapter
2, section 7.2.2). Its SC corresponds to an adjective autonomously attested in
Greek: αἰόλος ‘quick-moving’. This fact is important for the interpretation of
35 The use of suffixes is particularly required in exocentric categories, such as prepositional
compounds: see further Chapter 2, section 7.1. In ἐγκέφαλος γ represents [ɳ], arising from
assimilation of ἐν to the initial [k] of κέφαλ-.

κορυθαιόλος, because there are no morphological markers (such as the suffixes
mentioned above) that distinguish the SC of the compound from the simple adjec-
tive. Accentuation too is an unhelpful criterion for compoundhood in this case.
κορυθαιόλος is variously accented in modern texts: the most common accentu-
ation is regressive (κορυθαίoλoς) but the grammarian Herodian (3.1.228.12–13
Lentz) advised that the compound was to be accented like the simplex and this
is why the accentuation in LSJ is κορυθαιόλος.36 More importantly, there are no
morpho-phonological features such the presence of a linking vowel or the length-
ening of the initial vowel of the SC that signal Kompositionsfuge. In principle, we
may even doubt that κορυθαιόλος is a compound at all. The sequence <ΚΟΡΥΘΑΙ-
ΟΛΟΣ>, written in continuous writing, can be rendered as both κορυθαιόλος and
κόρυθ’ αἰόλος: the latter is a two-word phrase in which κόρυθ(α) is an accusative
of respect restricting the meaning of the adjective (‘swift/glittering as concerns
the helmet’: essentially the same meaning as the compound). Thus there is no
formal criterion which guarantees the classification of the Homeric adjective as
a compound, and if we tend to do so it is because in our texts the form is written
(and hence interpreted) as one word rather than as a phrase.
     This leads us to the second practical problem, the mode of transmission of
AG texts. The Homeric poems are a good example. It is assumed that these texts
were written down after a relatively long oral phase sometime around or after the
eighth century BC. The graphic conventions in use at the time involved scriptio
continua, the use of capitals, the absence of diacritics and (in most local varie-
ties of the alphabet) the absence of graphemes for /e:/ and /o:/ sounds. At some
point, this old text was transliterated into a more modern script (the phenomenon
known as metagrammatismós), a transformation which requires interpretative
choices in the realms of phonology (particularly as concerns the quality of /e:/
and /o:/ sounds and initial aspiration) and word-division. In the particular case
of κορυθαιόλος we are lucky to have Herodian’s testimony, which shows that the
interpretation as one word has ancient authority. In most other cases, however,
linguists depend entirely on the choices made by ancient and modern editors, a
fact which underlines the differing nature of the challenges facing ancient and
modern linguists.
36 Herodian based this accentuation on the fact that, in his opinion, the SC derived from
the verb αἰόλλω ‘to shift rapidly’ rather than from the adjective. The image conveyed by the
compound probably refers to the shining of the helmet rather than to physical movement: the
meaning is analysed in Chapter 2, section 7.2.2, following the interpretation of Méndez Dosuna
(2011) and Méndez Dosuna (2012).

5 Semantic approaches to compounding
The previous sections briefly brought semantics into the picture through a con-
sideration of its role in the definition of compoundhood. Before reviewing some
of the proposed approaches, we must pay attention to the term ‘semantics’ itself.
Although the term evokes the idea of ‘meaning’, investigating the semantics of
compounds involves much more than an elucidation of what a compound means,
and it has become part of complex conceptual models, such as the Parallel Archi-
tecture theorized by Jackendoff (1990) or the Lexical Semantics posited in Lieber
(2004).
     Lieber (2006), Lieber (2009a), Jackendoff (2009), and Jackendoff (2010) all
propose models to investigate the semantics of complex words (and thus also of
compounds), and these models focus on the semantic functions of minimal units
such as affixes and simple lexemes. These minimal units are classified within
a model of representation which, in turn, allows the semantic classification of
more complex units, on the assumption that ‘the meaning of a compound is a
function of the meanings of its constituents’.37 Lieber identifies basic semantic
functions (which she calls the ‘semantic skeleton’): one example is ‘material’,
which defines substances and essences and corresponds to the syntactic func-
tion of ‘noun’. To these quite abstract functions Lieber adds more concrete ones,
which she calls the ‘semantic body’: these are functions influenced by culture
and personal perception, for instance the notion of ‘animate’ as an embodiment
of the semantic function of ‘material’.38
     Recent contributions have applied these theoretical frameworks to the defini-
tion of compounds, which in turn is intimately bound up with the classification of
individual compound categories.39 Although in principle these are two separate
questions, they share many assumptions: to classify compounds according to dif-
ferent criteria (semantic, morphological, syntactic...) means first to have a notion
of which criteria rule the joining of individual lexemes into compounds. By apply-
ing conceptual semantics to their classification of compounds (to which we will
return later) Bisetto and Scalise (2005), followed by Scalise and Bisetto (2009), for
instance implicitly recognize its differentiating role in telling compounds apart
from non-compounds.
     Another recent semantic approach to compounds is Onomasiology, which
has flourished in Central Europe and posits that meaning drives patterns of word
formation. Onomasiology privileges the cognitive analysis of word formation over
37 Jackendoff (2009: 115).
38 See the examples in Lieber (2009a: 82–87).
39 Lieber (2009a), Jackendoff (2009) and, to an extent, Scalise and Bisetto (2009: 48–49).

its formal analysis, focusing on the roles of the speaker and the hearer, and on
their perception of language. Conceptual structures are expressed by means of
general categories (e.g. ‘substance’) which are then further classified according
to their properties (e.g. ‘quality’, ‘action’, ‘agent’, though the details are very
different in each model) and these in turn are used to describe compounds and
other patterns of word formation. As pointed out by Grzega (2009: 218), onoma-
siological accounts of word formation do not usually distinguish compounding
from other morphological processes, since all are analysed according to the same
onomasiological categories. Grzega’s model is the only one which distinguishes
the ‘junction of morphemes’ (and thus not only lexemes) from other types of
‘name-giving processes’ (e.g. loanwords) by the use of the term ‘composite’.
     Apart from the odd theoretical foray into the definition of compounds vis-à-vis
other types of word formation, Onomasiology—like Lexical Semantics—is mostly
tailored towards the classification of individual compound types, providing an
alternative model for thinking about the relation between compound constit-
uents. It is interesting, for instance, that the different onomasiological models
agree on separating forms such as strawberry, gooseberry and raspberry—which
in traditional accounts belong to the same compound category, [N N] subordi-
nated compounds—into different classes.40
5.1 Lexicalization and idiomaticity
When a word is adopted into the lexicon of a language and becomes a readily
available means of denoting a required concept, we speak of the lexicalization
of that word. In compounds, lexicalization entails that two or more lexemes have
become indissolubly linked from a semantic point of view, so that the determiner
cannot be substituted without a complete change in meaning (for a definition of
‘determiner’, see next section).41 For instance, while in the phrases red clothes
and black clothes the difference in meaning caused by the change of determiner
is limited (both indicate something which remains the same regardless of its
colour), the compound blackbird (indicating a specific species of bird and not
just a black bird) cannot be changed into **brownbird without the semantics of
the whole word being considerably altered.
     A consequence of lexicalization is idiomaticity.42 Spencer (1991: 312) draws
attention to the fact that ‘compounds are often subject to a semantic drift of a

kind associated with stored words, which means that their meaning becomes
non-compositional or even totally idiosyncratic’. He exemplifies this with the
Turkish compound şıp sevdi, lit. [plop! + he-has-fallen-in-love] > ‘impressiona-
ble’. Idiomaticity stems from the combined effect of three phenomena: the spe-
cialization of certain lexemes as compound constituents, resulting in their subse-
quent grammaticalization; their parallel disappearance from common language
as independent words; and phonetic and morphological changes. It is this phe-
nomenon which has turned Old English compounds into Modern English ‘words’,
and OE words into Modern English suffixes: see for instance lord, deriving from
the OE compound hlafweard ‘master of the loaves’ > ‘master of the house’ (from
hlaf ‘loaf’ and weard ‘keeper’), and childhood, deriving from the OE compound
childhad, where had is the word identifying state or condition.
5.2 Lexicalization and idiomaticity in Ancient Greek
Lexicalization and idiomaticity are also frequent in AG. The former is a very
common feature of compounds, but not all lexicalized compounds have constit-
uents which are semantically and morphologically obscure: the V1 compound
κλεψύδρα lit. ‘steal-water’ does not immediately evoke the idea of a water-clock,
but its meaning is nevertheless explicable from the semantics of the individual con-
stituents. Idiomaticity on the other hand is typical of forms whose meaning has no
immediate connection with the original semantics of the constituents. An account
of idiomaticity in Greek compounding is beyond the scope of this chapter and
indeed of the whole volume, but the fact that the V1 compounds collected in our
Corpus remain quite transparent makes such an account a pressing desideratum.
      A special case of idiomaticity concerns forms whose morphological make-up
has been obscured by changes in phonology, morphology and the lexicon, with
the result that the individual components were probably difficult to analyse for
speakers. For instance, in δάπεδον ‘floor’ the SC is the semantically transpar-
ent πέδον ‘ground’, but only comparative linguistics clarifies that the FC is the
zero grade *dm̥- of the root *dem- ‘to build’, which is also behind the word δόμος
‘house’. δάπεδον meant therefore literally ‘the floor of a house’, but the structure
of the compound was obscured in AG. In the word for ‘stool’, δίφρος, the FC can
still be linked to the adverb δίς ‘twice’, but the SC is a bound form which speak-
ers are unlikely to have linked to the verb φέρω ‘to carry’: again, the original
meaning of the compound was literal (a stool is something that can be ‘carried
at both sides’), but the morphology of the form was unclear in Classical Greek.

6 Syntactic approaches to compounding
In section 5 strawberry, gooseberry and raspberry were defined as ‘[N N] subordi-
nated compounds’, and this classification is based on a syntactic criterion. Syn-
tactic analyses play a significant role in studies of compounding. They inform
the approach that scholars take to issues which go beyond the definition of
compoundhood and affect the structure of compounds, for instance headedness
(section 7.1). Our starting point is again Marchand’s definition, in which com-
pounding is described in the following terms:
     The coining of new words proceeds by way of combining linguistic elements on the basis
     of a determinant / determinatum relationship called syntagma. When two or more words
     are combined into a morphological unit on the basis just stated, we speak of a compound.
     Marchand (1969: 11).
Marchand begins by emphasizing the relationship between the compound con-
stituents, a relationship which can only be clarified by transposing the constitu-
ents into a syntactic phrase (‘syntagma’). Let us first consider two simple cases.
Blackbird is a bird (determinatum) which is black (determinant), girlfriend is a
friend (determinatum) who is a girl (determinant). In both cases, the determi-
natum occurs on the right, while the determinant, either an adjective or a noun,
occurs on the left; more recent accounts would term the determinatum ‘head’ and
the determinant ‘non-head’ (or ‘determiner’, or ‘modifier’).44
     Syntactic transposition is particularly useful for the analysis of [N N] com-
pounds whose structure, and consequently meaning, are less straightforward:
only through a syntactic conversion can we clarify that a steamboat is not a
boat which is a steam (as in the examples blackbird and girlfriend above), but
a boat (determinatum) powered by steam (determinant). The structure of the
compounds is superficially identical, but their underlying syntactic structure is
different, since in steamboat steam is not a predicate substantive (> ‘the boat is a
steam’, as in blackbird > ‘the bird is black’ and girlfriend > ‘the friend is a girl’) but
a complement of means.
43 For other examples of obscured compounds, see Brugmann (1904–1905), Debrunner (1917:
21–22) and Hirt (1928: 21–25).
44 This terminology is misleading: not all determinata are heads. See section 9.3.

6.1 Synthetic compounds
A very high number of compounds resist being subsumed under Marchand’s defi-
nition and some of the points of contention will be discussed in the sections at
the end of the chapter dealing with the classification of compounds. A brief con-
sideration of some of these problematic issues, however, is useful for an overview
of syntactic approaches to compounding. Our starting point is the issue of com-
pounds with a verbal constituent, e.g. taxi-driver.
      This is a very common type of compound in English, and in Germanic lan-
guages generally. Because the non-verbal FC mostly functions as the internal
argument (in this case the direct object) of the verbal idea expressed by the second
element, these compounds are usually called ‘synthetic compounds’ (another
common term is ‘verbal compounds’). The term ‘synthetic’ draws attention to
the fact that these compounds represent the synthesis of a structure involving
a Noun and a Verb in which the Noun fulfils the function of the argument of the
Verb (he drives a taxi). In generative terms, the difference between these verbal/
synthetic compounds and other types of compounds is that ‘in verbal derivations
we often have more than one argument available for co-indexing’.45 Put more
simply, this means that synthetic compounds project more than one argument
into the syntax, making their lexical interpretation more complex than that of
other compound types. Although non-linguists may think of taxi-driver as simply
another [N N]N compound, linguists tend to hold that, by and large, these forms
arise from phrases containing a verb. Many accounts thus explain the structure
and meaning of these verbal synthetic compounds by focusing on the underly-
ing syntactic structures from which, according to some (but by no means all) lin-
guists, synthetic compounds derive by way of transformation.46
      Synthetic compounds are analysed according to two basic structures:
[[N VStem]er]N (i.e. a structure which is formed with a noun and a verbal stem,
to which the derivational suffix -er is added to turn this structure into a noun)
or [N N]N (i.e. a structure in which a verbal noun is compounded with another
noun). The first model, which has mainly been developed by Lieber (1983), does
not work perfectly in that, as shown by Booij (1988), [N V] compounded verbs
such as **taxi-drive are seldom attested in English.47 Drawing on the second
model, therefore, Booji (1988) suggests a somewhat different derivational path.
45 Lieber (2004: 54).
46 This approach was first theorized and fully developed in Roeper and Siegel (1978): for a
critique, see Selkirk (1982: 43–47), who in turn initiated the lexicalist approach continued in the
later works of Lieber (1983), Di Sciullo and Williams (1987) and Booij (1988).
47 See too the resumé in Booij (2009a: 213) and Lieber (2004: 47–48), who accepts the criticism.

He assumes that synthetic compounds are [N N] formations in which the head
is a verbal noun, a structure which can be represented as [N [Ner]]N. Structurally,
synthetic compounds do not derive from compounded [N V] verbs, but semanti-
cally they display a special feature, termed ‘inheritance of argument structure’,
in virtue of which ‘the verbal noun inherits the Patient argument of the verb, and
the left constituent receives this Patient role’.48
     This leads us to a second problem, the interpretation of the relationship
between the verbal SC and the nominal FC. Although theoretical discussions of
synthetic compounds usually focus on compounds in which the FC functions as
the direct object of the verbal SC, across languages (and AG is no exception), the
nominal FC often conveys other functions, for instance location (e.g. Skywalker,
moonwalker), time (e.g. day-dreamer) or adverbial modification (e.g. big spender).49
Stricter accounts limit the category of synthetic compounds to those forms in
which the FC is an argument of the second, satisfying one of the thematic roles
(simply put, these are the arguments that each verb syntactically requires). All the
others, in which the FC adds a ‘locative, manner, or temporal specification to the
head, but would not be said to bear a thematic relation, or satisfy the argument
structure of the head’, are excluded.50
     These two issues connected with the interpretation and definition of a com-
pound category which is prevalent in many languages give us a fair picture of
how syntactic analyses, sometimes of great complexity, can affect both how we
describe the processes at work in the formation of individual types of compounds
and how we distinguish between compounds and other linguistic structures.
Synthetic compounds are also much-discussed as concerns the morphological
interpretation of their verbal constituent, which in many languages tend to be
stems: this phenomenon is well-known to Sanskrit and Greek scholars, but also
applies to some English compounds.51 We will return to this problem in two
different places: in section 9.2, which discusses the notion of government, and
in Chapter 2, section 6, which is specifically concerned with Greek compounds
possessing a verbal SC.
     The syntactic approach is also frequently applied to V1 compounds, which are
studied in relation to parallel phrases in order to gain insights into their origin,
orientation and morphological make-up. As we shall see in Chapter 2, section 7.5.4,
the syntactic approach has prompted a few scholars to interpret V1 compounds as

49 Bloomfield (1933: 231-232) and Marchand (1969: 15–19) both tend to match synthetic com-
pounds with the object-verb relationship.

a ‘more syntactic’ category than others that still preserves an inflected verb in the
FC (this is usually interpreted as an imperative or third person singular present).
According to these interpretations, syntax overrides morphology, but it is open
to debate whether this is the correct way to view the origin of individual V1 com-
pounds cross-linguistically: as concerns AG, our analysis will show that the produc-
tive formation patterns of V1 compounds are morphological, not syntactic.
6.2 Romance compounds
The syntactic approach is also fundamental to the investigation of compound-
ing as a result of the lexicalization of phrases, and to the differentiation of com-
pounds from syntactic phrases. As mentioned above, it is typical of English to
have forms such as word formation which are not univerbated but whose morpho-
logical and phonological properties, on the whole, allow for their classification
as compounds. Romance, by contrast, has a limited number of straightforward
compounds (most commonly of the [N N] and [V N] types) but a large number of
phrases whose status is hotly debated. In this case, our analysis of the properties
displayed by these forms will determine whether we define them as compounds.
     Romance phrases that are open to being interpreted as compounds include
the following types:
– Forms in which the constituents are linked by a preposition (also termed
     ‘binomial compounds’): Fr. pied à terre [foot on ground] > ‘small living unit’,
     pomme de terre [apple of earth] > ‘potato’; Sp. estrella de mar [star of sea] >
     ‘starfish’, It. casa di cura [house of treatment] > ‘nursing home’; Port. boca de
     incêndio [mouth of fire] > ‘fire hydrant’; Rom. lapte-de-pasăre [milk of bird],
     a kind of dessert.
According to many accounts, all such forms ought to be considered lexicalized
phrases (also termed ‘syntactic compounds’ or ‘improper compounds’) rather
than proper compounds because they lack the morpho-phonological variation
typical of compounding.52 However, other scholars maintain that many of these
forms should be classified as true compounds, since they represent conceptual
52 The literature on the topic is vast. The following are recent works which discuss the issue
in various Romance languages and provide state-of-the-art references: French: Corbin (1992:
48–49), Villoing (2003), Fradin (2009: 417–420) and Villoing (2012: 35–36); Spanish: Fabb (1998:
76) and Kornfeld (2009: 437, 442–443) on Spanish [N de N] compounds, drawing from Rainer and
Varela (1992) and Val Alvaro (1999); Italian: Masini (2009), Masini and Scalise (2012: 71–75); Por-
tuguese: Rio-Torto and Ribeiro (2012: 126–127); Romanian: Grossmann (2012: 153–154).

units and score positively in the isolation test. This means that it is impossible to
separate their constituents with determiners or quantifiers, as in e.g. pomme de
terre **fertile lit. ‘apple of fertile soil’, estrella de(**l) mar, or casa di cura **inten-
siva ‘house of intensive treatment’.
– Forms in which the FC is a preposition: Fr. sans papier [without paper] > ‘clan-
     destine’, Sp. sin vergüenza / sinvergüenza [without shame] > ‘scoundrel’, It.
     controluce [against light] > ‘backlight’, Port. după-amiază [after-noon]. These
     forms can be used as adjectives or nouns.53
Again, a heated debate surrounds the analysis of these prepositional forms. They
may be classified as proper compounds on account of their lexicalized status
(some are even univerbated),54 but they may also be considered prepositional
phrases.
– Forms in which a noun is modified by an adjective to its right (Fr. guerre froide
     [war cold] > ‘Cold War’, It. carta telefonica [card of-the-phone] > ‘phone-card’,
     Sp. fiebre amarilla [fever yellow] > ‘yellow fever’) or to its left (Fr. premier
     minister ‘prime minister’, Sp. media luna ‘half moon’).
These forms display a high degree of lexicalization and idiomaticity, both of
which semantic properties are typical of compounds: the adjectival constituents
cannot be replaced by a synonym (e.g. guerre glaciale [war icy] > ‘icy war’) or
by another adjective of the same class (e.g. fiebre roja [fever red] > ‘red fever’)
without the expression losing its characteristic meaning. At the same time,
these forms lack some of the elements which characterize compoundhood in the
individual Romance languages, with the result that some accounts class them
among improper compounds. For instance, Spanish [N A] compounds usually
display special morpho-phonological markers: in pelirrojo ‘red-haired’ we find
the linking vowel -i- and the first sound of the SC -rrojo doubled, whereas the
corresponding phrase pelo rojo does not display the same markers.55 The Italian
[A N] form terzo mondo and [N A] form carta telefonica show internal agreement,
a property which distinguishes them from proper compounds.56 Forms such as
premier ministre also follow the general syntactic formation rules of French.57

and the references given in the previous note for accounts in individual languages.

–    Left-headed forms in which a noun is modified by another noun: Fr. cigarette
     filtre [cigarette filter] > ‘filter cigarette’; Sp. perro policía [dog police] > ‘police
     dog’; It. effetto serra [effect greenhouse] > ‘greenhouse effect’.58
These are usually considered to be proper rather than improper compounds,
though it is recognized that they share many properties with phrases and apposi-
tions (both syntactic categories).59
     This brief overview of Romance types shows how the same category of forms
can elicit very different responses from scholars depending on their theoretical
framework. In all cases, however, the role of syntax is of primary importance.
According to the classic study of Di Sciullo and Williams (1987), Romance com-
pounds are produced by syntax before being subjected to a morphological reanal-
ysis: they are not, therefore, ‘true’ compounds (ruled by morphology) but ‘syntac-
tic words’. In her overview of Spanish compounding, Kornfeld (2009: 444) claims
that ‘the constituents of compounds can always be explained by syntactic proper-
ties of Spanish’. On the other hand, Bisetto (2004) applies a semantic criterion for
differentiating compounds from phrasal terms, claiming that compounds tend to
be hyponyms of their heads, while phrasal terms are mostly not. The analysis of
morpho-phonological elements is perhaps most useful in the case of AG, where
compounds (but not phrasal terms or ‘improper compounds’) typically entail the
deletion of case and agreement markers in the FC, which becomes a simple stem
followed by a compositional vowel (section 4.1).
6.3 Recursiveness in compounding
A typical property of English compounds is recursiveness, i.e. the capacity of
determiners to accumulate to the left or to the right of the head. Spencer (1991:
48) puts forward the example of student film society committee scandal enquiry,
in which the primary element enquiry is modified by various additions to its left.
The textbook example for German is Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftska-
pitänsmütze ‘cap of the captain of the Danube steam ship company’, but recursive
structures are frequent in all Germanic languages, as well as in e.g. Japanese and
Turkish.60

59 See Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 81-82), Booij (2009b: 223).
60 These and other examples are discussed at length by Bisetto (2010), who is particularly con-
cerned with phenomena of recursiveness in Italian compounding. On recursiveness in coordinat-
ed compounds, see too Mukai (2013).

      The issue of recursiveness has not yet been addressed from a typological
point of view. In a recent attempt to reach a unified analysis, Bisetto (2010) shows
that some structures conventionally used as examples of recursiveness are in fact
better explained as iterations, with modifying elements to the non-head side.
This interpretative problem is central to the understanding of recursiveness in
coordinated compounds (compounds whose constituents can be connected with
the conjunction ‘and’: see section 8.1 and Chapter 2, section 2), the analysis of
which is often controversial. For instance, the classification of the Italian form
poeta pittore regista ‘poet-painter-director’ as a coordinated compound requires
us to interpret its elements as head additions, the distinguishing feature of recur-
siveness.61 The other option is to take regista as the sole head and poeta pittore
as non-head additions (i.e. modifying elements of a subordinated compound), in
which case the compound would display iteration, not recursiveness.
6.4 Syntactic approaches to Ancient Greek compounding: inflected FCs
6.4 and univerbations
Following the laconic differentiation between σύνθεσις and παράθεσις made by
the ancient Greek grammarians (see section 4), classic studies of AG compound-
ing sometimes refer to ‘improper compounds’ or ‘univerbations’ when analyzing
forms in which the FC is an inflected word representing an adjunct of the SC.62
An example is the toponym Ἡλιούπολις, literally ‘of-the-Sun-city’, in which the
FC Ἡλιου- is the genitive singular of ἥλιος ‘sun’. Another example is πυρίκαυστος
‘burnt in/by fire’, in which the FC may be interpreted as the dative of πῦρ, express-
ing the location or the means of the verbal action conveyed by the SC. These
forms defy the isolation rule and also go against the Greek tendency to use stems
in compounding. Because of this, it is usually assumed that these compounds
derive from the univerbation of two originally independent words. In itself, this is
a plausible supposition, but it also makes the classification of these forms prob-
lematic: to what extent are forms such as Ἡλιούπολις and πυρίκαυστος to be con-
sidered ‘improper’ compounds, as many scholars have claimed?63
61 Scalise and Bisetto (2009: 46).

     In principle, one might even deny that Ἡλιούπολις and πυρίκαυστος are one
word at all: as in the case of κορυθαιόλος discussed in section 4.4, the sequences
<ΗΛΙΟΥΠΟΛΙΣ> and <ΠΥΡΙΚΑΥΣΤΟΣ> could be rendered as Ἡλιοῦ πόλις and πυρὶ
καυστός, which are perfectly meaningful phrases in Greek. For Ἡλιούπολις the
matter is complicated by two facts: its evident lexicalization, since it was used
to refer to one place in particular, and its Latin rendition with one word, Helio-
polis, rather than two. Both facts testify to the perception of this form as a com-
pound. A similar case is the toponym Νεάπολις, which clearly derives from the
phrase νέα πόλις ‘new city’ (attested in Herodotus), but was imported into Latin
as one word, Neapolis. The case of πυρίκαυστος is more ambiguous, particularly
because passive adjectives in -τός, like καυστός ‘burnt’, are rarely compounded
with nouns.
     Caught between textual practice (which has handed down these and other
forms as single words) and theoretical issues, we may wonder whether placing
forms with an inflected FC in a separate category is really helpful for our clas-
sification of compounds. These forms, although not numerous, exerted a clear
influence on other compounds, so that some of the inflected FCs spread to com-
pounds where they were not syntactically justified. In section 4.1 we considered
the case where πυρι- replaces the stem-forms πυρ- and πυρο-: here the use of -ι- as
a linking element devoid of any morpho-syntactic role is likely to have been mod-
elled on forms such as πυρίκαυστος, where -ι- is syntactically justified. A different
kind of example is θεόσδοτος ‘given by god’ (Hes.): θεοσ- is not the stem of θεός
(which is θεο-), but something which looks like (but is not) a third-declension
genitive in -ος. The FC θεοσ- therefore was probably modelled on διοσ-, which
features in the synonym διόσδοτος ‘given of Zeus’: διοσ- itself is not a stem, but
the genitive singular of Ζεύς, which often features as compound FC.64
     Unfortunately the ancient grammarians do not come to our rescue. Ancient
discussion of ambiguous forms mostly appears in connection with Homeric
exegesis and is concerned, on a practical level, with the question of whether
certain Homeric forms should be written as one word or two (e.g. in the case of
κάρη κομόωντες ‘with flowing hair’ in the Iliad). Discussing the matter, Debrun-
ner (1917: 17) usefully observes that the distinction between univerbations and
‘proper’ compounds is not one of principle but of chronology: each individual
univerbation can, at a later stage of the language, become a ‘proper’ compound
and each ‘proper’ compound may, at some remote chronological point, have been
a univerbation. The suggestion is apparently that compounding implies a previ-
ous syntactic stage where words are joined in a fixed phrase: ‘proper’ compounds

(i.e. those using stems rather than inflected FCs) represent the highest level of
abstraction from this primitive stage.
     Debrunner’s short comment is by no means a banal one. Indo-Europeanists
of the late nineteenth century thought that the oldest stage of PIE was free of
inflections: as a consequence, ‘proper’ compounds could not contain inflected
elements, which would characterize only later and secondary formations.65
Debrunner, however, seems to point towards a different way of looking at the
matter, which takes relative chronology into account and, through the implica-
tion that compounding derives from syntax, anticipates some of the conclusions
reached by transformational grammar decades later.
     Recent research has paid more attention to the question of relative chronol-
ogy in the make-up of compounds, with the assumption being that univerbations
may have been more widespread than previously thought. Dunkel puts the ques-
tion in clear terms:
      Both types of combination are generally reconstructed for the Ursprache, but it is often
      taken for granted that stem compounds are older than univerbations. The only justification
      for this is that many attested univerbations, such as Πελοπόν-νησος and magnopere, are
      clearly of recent origin. But this does not change the fact that other univerbations, such as
      *déms-poti-, are very old indeed, as underlined by the extremely archaic morphology of the
      latter’s first element.
      Dunkel (1999: 47).
Dunkel goes on to argue that univerbations ‘make up both the very oldest and
the very youngest strata of morphological noun combination’, whereas stem
compounding, the supposedly primitive type of word formation, is ‘a histori-
cally intermediate stage’.66 From a Greek perspective, it is of little relevance that
δεσπότης ‘master’ goes back to the inflected juxtaposition *déms-poti- ‘lord of
the house’, because the form has been completely lexicalized.67 Other forma-
tions arose within Greek itself, but possess inflectional endings that are no longer
attested in the language. In ὁδοιπόρος ‘wayfarer’ the FC displays a form which
is not attested in the Classical declension of ὁδός ‘road’ and which is difficult
to explain as a mere linking vowel. Comparative analysis, however, helps us to
reconstruct ὁδοι- as the old locative case of the thematic declension, surviving in
some fixed expressions such as οἴκοι ‘at home’. Although we are able to recognize
the inflected nature of the FC, from the point of view of the linguistic stage rep-

resented by Greek it is pointless to place ὁδοιπόρος in a different category from
other compounds.
     In conclusion, the term ‘juxtaposition’ is useful only when there are other
phenomena, outside the inflected nature of the FC, which betray the syntactic
nature status of a sequence of two words. Since AG is a corpus language, however,
we are usually unable to run additional tests. For instance, Ralli (2013: 246–248)
identifies the following criteria as typical of compounds as opposed to syntactic
phrases:
1. A high degree of semantic opacity. Most Greek forms with an inflected FC
     score negatively in this test, since ὁδοιπόρος, Νεάπολις, Διόσκουροι are
     highly transparent forms.
2. The possibility of derivational suffixation. This gives better results, with
     forms such Nεαπολί-της ‘habitant of Neapolis’, ὁδοιπορ-ία ‘walking’, etc.
3. The constituents have no syntactic freedom: it is impossible to reverse their
     order (this applies to all quoted forms); the non-head cannot be replaced by
     another item without a considerable change of meaning (Ἡλιούπολις is a
     different entity from Νεάπολις); no other item can be inserted between the
     constituents.68
In conclusion, the definition of ‘improper’ compounds requires not only an under-
standing of the nature of the inflected FC, but also an assessment of the global
morpho-phonological and semantic properties of these forms.69 The impact of
forms with an inflected FC is marginal in Greek, however, where compounding
remains by and large stem compounding.
6.5 Summary
Synthetic compounds, Romance ambiguous categories, V1 compounds and
recursive structures are some prominent examples of the impact that syntax has
on compounding, and hence of the importance of syntactic analysis. This section
has briefly addressed topics which go beyond the definition of compounds and
touch upon the interpretation of compound categories. In the next chapter, syn-
tactic approaches will be used to discuss the structure of AG compounds, and the
68 Similar and other criteria are also indicated by Lindner (2011: 11).
69 Ralli (2013: 248–249) suggests differentiating forms which have properties in common with
both compounds and nominal phrases with the term ‘loose multiword compounds’ or ‘phrasal
terms’. The application of this terminology to AG is beyond our scope, but could be a promising
research topic.

issue of their orientation in particular will be explored in view of Greek, and more
generally IE, word-order patterns. As concerns the relationship of V1 and V2 com-
pounds, in the course of this volume we will see that these types are generated
through a morphological process rather than by syntax, but we will also see that
syntactic phrases may influence the creation of individual compounds.
7 Towards the classification of compounds: basic criteria
So far this chapter has reviewed some areas which are important for a formal
description of Greek compounds: the use of stems, the form and role of the linking
vowel, accentuation, the spelling of compounds and the analysis of forms with
an inflected FC. Before turning to the classification of the Greek compound types
(a classification based on the relationship between the constituents), we need to
consider two further criteria which play a central part in current classifications of
compounds cross-linguistically: the notion of ‘head’ (and its position within the
compound) and the related issues of ‘endocentricity’ and ‘exocentricity’.
7.1 Heads, headedness and related issues
The identification of the ‘head’ of a compound is fundamental to the structural
issues concerning the syntax and semantics of compounds, and hence to their
classification. The property of containing a head is termed ‘headedness’ in
current morphological theory. Since headedness is a vast and complex topic, here
we will consider it simply with the aim of understanding how headedness applies
to compounding.
     Let us start with two definitions:
     The head of a word or phrase is that part which defines its category [...]. In derivational
     morphology the category of a simple word is often determined by its outermost suffix. Thus
     English -ness marks a word as a noun.
     IEL s.v. ‘head’.
     The identifying feature of heads in both syntax and morphology is that the properties of the
     head are those of the whole.
     Di Sciullo and Williams (1987: 25).
These are both morphological definitions of ‘head’. As such, they concern all
words: in teacher, for instance, the suffix -er is the head, since it determines
                                                          Olga Tribulato - 9783110415827

44         Chapter One – Compounding and the Classiication of Compounds
gender, case, number and the morpho-syntactic category of the word.70 In the
compound school teacher, however, the whole word teacher is the head, since it
determines the category to which the compound belongs (i.e. a school teacher is
a type of teacher). There is an important difference between these two examples.
The suffix -er is the head of the word teacher on morphological grounds, whereas
the identification of the word teacher as the head of the compound school teacher
takes place on the level of semantics.71 Without knowing the meaning of school
teacher, it would be impossible to decide that it represents a type of teacher (and
hence that teacher is its head) and to distinguish the category of compound under
which it falls from others, e.g. that of cutpurse ‘thief’ (which is not a type of purse:
hence, we can predict that purse is not its head). Further analysis shows that the
FC of cutpurse is not the head either, since cutpurse does not identify a subtype of
the action of cutting, but ‘someone who steals by cutting purses suspended on a
waistband’. It follows that cutpurse does not have a head: it is headless. This has
an important impact on the classification of cutpurse and similar compounds.
7.2 Endocentric and exocentric compounds
In many accounts, compounds with a head are termed ‘endocentric’. This adjec-
tive may be literally translated as ‘having a sematic focus (‘-centric’) which lies
within (‘endo-’) itself’: school teacher refers semantically to a type of teacher, an
idea already contained within the compound itself; the FC school merely modi-
fies it (and hence, as already mentioned, is termed the ‘determinant’ or ‘modi-
fying element’ or ‘non-head’). Cutpurse, on the other hand, is classified by most
accounts as an ‘exocentric’ compound. This adjective may be literally translated
as ‘having a semantic focus which lies outside (‘exo-’) itself’: cutpurse refers to a
type of thief, an idea which is semantically contained neither in the compound
as a whole nor in one of its constituents. Nevertheless, the relation between the
two constituents has a hierarchical nature not dissimilar to that found in school
teacher: in cutpurse, purse functions as a sort of specification of the action of
cutting, distinguishing it from other types of cutting (e.g. the cutting of throats,
to which the similarly exocentric cutthroat ‘murderer’ alludes). As a result, the
constituents purse and throat function as modifying elements, and hence as
‘non-heads’. The complication, however, is that, unlike the case of school teacher,

the FC cut also is a ‘non-head’, and this despite the fact that, just like teacher in
school teacher, it functions as the determinatum.72
     Another class of compounds which are typically exocentric (and hence lack
a head) are the so-called ‘bahuvrihis’ or possessive compounds (see Chapter 2,
section 5). These compounds indicate a quality or thing possessed by a person:
e.g. long-nose, which is not a type of nose, but a person characterized by a type
of nose. In both long-nose (in the sense ‘person with a long nose’) and school
teacher, nose and teacher are affected by the same kind of modification through
long and school respectively, the difference being that school teacher does not
manifest the same shift of semantic focus as long-nose: school teacher has a head,
while long-nose does not. The exocentric status acquired by long-nose is neither
intrinsic to the word nose, nor to the formal make-up of the compound itself: it
emerges once long-nose is used to describe an entity that lies outside the word
category indicated by either of its constituents. In Chapter 2, section 5.2, we will
return to this issue when considering the relationship between bahuvrihis and
determinative compounds in AG.
7.3 Right-headed and left-headed compounds
In most languages, the head tends to occur towards the right of the compound:
English (and, in general, all Germanic languages) provides the typical example
of a right-headed compound system. There are also compound systems, however,
in which the head is frequently, or even standardly, located on the left: common
examples come from Romance (e.g. pause café [break coffee] ‘coffee break’, vin-
aigre [wine sour] ‘vinegar’ and main-forte [hand strong] ‘support’ in French;
pausa pranzo [stop lunch] ‘lunch break’ and capostazione [head station] ‘station-
master’ in Italian), but typological studies of compounding also list instances
from Samoan (e.g. potumoe [room bed] ‘bedroom’), Vietnamese (e.g. nhà thuong
[establishment be wounded] ‘hospital’) and Chinese (though only in the [V N]V type,
e.g. j̀nd́ [prohibit poison] ‘to prohibit the selling and consuming of drugs’).73 In
72 The current terminology goes back to Aleksandrow (1888) and was divulgated by Brugmann
in his contributions on compounding, particularly Brugmann (1905–1906). Bloomfield (1933)
adopted the same terminology to describe syntactic structures, with slightly different theoretical
implications: cf. the definitions of ‘endocentric’ and ‘exocentric’ in Bussmann (1996: 363; 394)
and Barri (1975). For the history of the term ‘exocentric’, see Noordegraaf (1989). For an up-to-
date overview of these issues in IE linguistics, see Lindner (2011: 24–28).

46          Chapter One – Compounding and the Classiication of Compounds
the right-headed English system many left-headed compounds are modelled on
Romance types: e.g. Engl. attorney general or knight errant < chevalier errant.
      Linguists often suppose that left-headedness derives from the imitation of
the standard word order in a given language: left-headed compounds, therefore,
would originally represent the lexicalization of syntactic structures rather than
being the result of a morphological process.74 There is, indeed, a certain degree
of overlap between left-headedness and the tendency to develop syntactic com-
pounds: this is clearly the case in Romance, where, as noted above, many cate-
gories can be interpreted as syntactic structures. In another language, Chinese,
the common left-headed [V N]V structures are often interpreted to be syntactic
phrases, not compounds.75
      AG may be of some use in the context of this debate. Greek has a right-headed
compound system which, however, tolerates a number of left-headed types (see
Chapter 2, section 7, for a full analysis). Let us take the example of ἱπποπόταμος
‘hippopotamus’ (lit. [horse river]). The head ἱππο- ‘horse’ is not the individual
word ἵππος, but its bare stem: this suggests that a fully morphological process
was involved in the formation of ἱπποπόταμος rather than the univerbation of a
syntactic phrase. Moreover, the equivalent of the phrase ‘horse of the river’ would
be either ἵππος ποτάμιος (with the second word being an adjective ending with
the suffix -ιος and meaning ‘of the river’) or ἵππος ποταμοῦ (with the second word
being the genitive singular of ‘river’). In either case, the corresponding compound
constituent -πόταμος has undergone a process of morphological derivation,
having lost the morpho-syntactic markers of its antecedent (be it ποτάμιος or
ποταμοῦ) and having acquired a new suffix, -ος. It is probable that the left-head-
edness in this case is influenced by syntactic patterns, but the make-up and pro-
ductivity of the individual left-headed types is to be accounted for in morpholog-
ical terms (see Chapter 2, section 7.3 specifically on this class).76
7.4 Summary
After this brief overview of headedness and the position of heads in compounds
it is worth summarizing the following points:
74 On this view, see e.g. Spencer (1991: 321) and the claim by Di Sciullo and Williams (1987) that
all true endocentric compounds are right-headed.
75 But see Ceccagno and Basciano (2009: 489), who disagree with this interpretation.

                           7 Towards the classiication of compounds: basic criteria          47
1.    ‘endocentric’ and ‘exocentric’ (i.e. the presence or absence of head) are uni-
      versal properties of compounds, although there is a tendency for endocentric
      categories to be more widespread (see section 7.3).
2. ‘Endocentric’ is not equivalent to ‘right-headed’ (as sometimes claimed on
      the basis of the English compound system): AG in particular shows that there
      can also be endocentric left-headed compounds in languages whose com-
      pound system is mostly right-headed (Chapter 2, sections 7.3–7.4).
3. Exocentric compounds are headless; nevertheless, the relation linking the
      compound constituents can be identical to that characterizing endocentric
      compounds, e.g. when the compound is of the modifier-deteminatum type
      (see below).
4. Syntax may influence the creation of left-headed types in largely right-headed
      systems, but the example of Greek shows that not all such cases are to be ana-
      lysed as syntactic phrases (i.e. ‘improper’ compounds’).
7.5 Syntax and semantics as classificatory criteria
The previous sections have discussed headedness by applying a semantic anal-
ysis to compounds: through an examination both of the logical relationship
holding between the constituents and of the meaning of the resulting compound,
it is possible to tell whether the compound has a head or not. Such a logical rela-
tionship is best described by means of syntactic models:
      The elements of a compound may have relations to each other which resemble the relations
      holding between the constituents of a sentence [...]: head – modifier, predicate – argument,
      and apposition’.
      Spencer (1991: 310).
As discussed in section 6.1, one dimension of the syntactic study of compounding
has been a focus on the possibility of transforming compounds into their cor-
responding phrases, and this proves to be particularly useful when it comes to
assigning a given compound to a specific category. A case in point is the identifi-
cation of the meaning of cry-baby as ‘person easily reduced to tears’. On the basis
of the structure of other compounds with verbal FCs (e.g. cutpurse), one might
be tempted to take cry as the governing element of baby. This would result in the
phrase making a baby cry, which is ill-suited to the contexts in which cry-baby is
likely to be found. It is only when we transform cry-baby into the correct phrase a
baby that cries that both the meaning and the structure of the compound can be
clarified (‘a person who complains with little cause’). Part of the ambiguity of this

48           Chapter One – Compounding and the Classiication of Compounds
and similar forms lies in the fact that English words such as cry can be interpreted
as both verbs and nouns.
     The transformational approach, however, is not completely unproblematic,
since a number of compounds resist a transparent syntactic and semantic expla-
nation, and it has been criticized by those scholars who prefer to view compound-
ing as an essentially morphological and lexical process. An example often quoted
to show the shortcomings of the syntactic approach is striptease, the meaning of
which can be guessed neither on the basis of the meaning of the individual con-
stituents nor by applying a common syntactic pattern (for instance the verb-pred-
icate pattern).77 In such extreme cases, the syntactic analysis follows the disclos-
ing of the correct meaning on the part of someone who knows it. Since striptease
is a kind of erotic entertainment (tease) in which a person gradually undresses
(strip), it is possible to conclude that the constituent elements lie on the same
syntactic level, being coordinated actions (strip and tease at the same time).
According to this analysis, striptease is classed among coordinated compounds
(see section 8.1), but the meaning given above could also be seen to express a syn-
tactic structure in which tease is the head and strip a modifier with an instrumen-
tal function (tease the viewer by stripping clothes): in this second case, striptease
would be classified among subordinated compounds (see section 8.1). Similarly,
the constituents of the American English noun and verb high-five (‘a celebratory
gesture in which two people slap their hands together high over their heads’) are
clear, yet it would be impossible for someone unfamiliar with basketball or Amer-
ican slang to predict the meaning of this compound by applying a straightforward
syntactic analysis, since five does not actually denote a number, but is a meta-
phor for ‘open hand’.
     In most cases syntactic transformation serves as a useful means of clarifying
the meaning and structure of compounds, since a merely formal description is not
sufficient to detect any semantic difference between similar-looking structures,
e.g. cry-baby and cutpurse, car-driving and sky-diving. However, there are also
cases in which more than one syntactic interpretation applies: is house cleaning
a ‘cleaning of the house’ or a ‘cleaning in the house’? As mentioned in section
6.1, these difficulties are particularly salient for compounds containing a verbal
noun, since the relationship between the constituents can be seen either in terms
of determination or in terms of government (see too section 9.2).

8. A model of classification
Morphologists busy themselves not only with providing definitions of compound-
ing, but also with offering formal descriptions and classifications of compound
types, and identifying the best criteria on which to base those classifications. The
topic has received a huge amount of attention in the specialist literature on com-
pounding and I shall refrain from providing a potted history of the field’s devel-
opment. This section, and the theoretical classification which follows, are based
on the recent proposal for a new typological classification of compounding made
by Sergio Scalise and Antonietta Bisetto, whose contributions to the topic also
provide a basic introduction to past classifications.78
     The main problems facing students of compounding when they address the
issue of the definition of compounds are the variety of criteria adopted for the
purpose of classification and, consequently, the inconsistent terminology used
to describe compound types. It frequently happens that language-specific terms
are used to describe universal categories: a good example is the category of ‘syn-
thetic compounds’, which is central in English but by no means universal (for
instance, it is generally absent in Romance). Moreover, confusion may arise from
the improper use of certain terms, as is the case with the Sanskrit terms ‘bahuvr-
ihi’ and ‘dvandva’ (see section 9.1).79
     As noted above, the classification of compounds rests on morphological,
semantic and syntactic analyses or, more frequently, on a combination of the
three criteria, which are able to complement one another in the case of con-
troversy. However, the application of these criteria is often inconsistent across
the various classificatory models, and sometimes even within the same model.
Scalise and Bisetto (2009) place particular emphasis on the fact that most clas-
sifications are based on the criterion of presence/absence of a head (a criterion
which, as noted in section 7.1, is driven by semantic analysis), and hence on the
categories of endocentricity and exocentricity. However, endocentricity and exo-
centricity are not overarching principles, each subsuming a number of compound
types: rather, they are transversal properties, which cut across each compound
category. Before headedness, therefore, classifications must attempt to identify
compound types on the basis of other criteria.

50          Chapter One – Compounding and the Classiication of Compounds
8.1 Subordinated and coordinated as the two fundamental categories
Following Scalise and Bisetto (2009), I propose a classification of AG compounds
based, in the first instance, on syntactic and semantic criteria, which identify
the nature of the relationship between the compound constituents and hence the
structure of the compound. At a second stage level of classification, morpholog-
ical analysis (i.e. the study of the formal make-up of the compound) may some-
times be adopted as a further criterion to highlight differences within the same
compound macro-category (for instance by distinguishing nominal from verbal
endocentric compounds). The third and final level of classification concerns
the presence or absence of a head, and this criterion subdivides the same macro-
category (e.g. subordinated compounds) into endocentric and exocentric sub-
types.
     The primary syntactic-semantic criterion is subordination, identifying com-
pound types in which one of the constituents is subordinated to the other, in that
it provides a complementation, argumentation or modification of the other.80
Consider the following examples of subordination:
1. In the [N N]N compound school teacher the FC school modifies the notion
     expressed by the SC teacher: in syntactic terms, it expresses location (‘teacher
     who works in a school’) or possession (‘teacher who belongs to a school’).
2. In the [N N]N compound silk-tail (the name of a type of bird), the FC silk modi-
     fies the SC tail: it expresses a quality of the SC and is semantically equivalent
     to an adjective.
3. In the [V N]N compound cutpurse the SC -purse is the argument of the verbal
     action conveyed by the FC cut- and is thus subordinated to it.
4. In the [N N]N compound taxi-driver, the FC expresses the argument of the
     verbal action conveyed by the SC driver (a noun derived from a verb) and is
     thus subordinated to it.
5. In the [P N]A compound upstream, the SC stream provides a complement to of
     the preposition contained in the FC and is thus subordinated to it.
The types of subordination represented in these examples are not of the same
kind. For the time being, however, we will focus on the property of headedness,
and we will consider the orientation of constituents and, in particular, the loca-
tion of the slot occupied by the subordinated element. The compounds in (1) and
(2) have an identical structure and their morphological category (Noun) is identi-
cal, but they diverge in terms of headedness: school-teacher is endocentric, while
80 In some accounts, the verb-argument relation is not subsumed under subordination: see
Scalise and Bisetto (2009: 44).

silk-tail is exocentric (it does not define a type of tail). Similarly, both the syntactic
structure and the resultant morphological category (Noun) of the examples in (3)
and (4) are identical, but again the compounds diverge in terms of headedness:
cutpurse is exocentric (it refers to a type of thief, not a type of cutting), while
taxi-driver is endocentric (it represents a subset or specialization of the notion of
‘driver’). Moreover, within the same syntactic structure (Verb-Argument) we find
two opposing orientations: cutpurse is left-oriented and the constituent express-
ing the argument occurs on the right; while taxi-driver is right-oriented and the
constituent expressing the argument occurs on the left. Different again is the case
of (5), in which the SC is strictly speaking properly governed by the first. Upstream
belongs to the typologically left-oriented category of prepositional compounds,
which are always exocentric: upstream does not express a subset of either up or
stream, but identifies an external entity which goes ‘against the current’.
     Subordination contrasts with another syntactic-semantic criterion: coor-
dination. This can be defined, in negative terms, as the ‘absence of subordina-
tion’: namely, no compound constituent is subordinated and all are placed on
the same syntactic level. Consider Austro-Hungary: it neither identifies a subtype
of Hungary (e.g. ‘Austrian Hungary’) nor a subtype of Austria (e.g. ‘Hungarian
Austria’), but a geo-political entity made up of both. Coordinated compounds
are less numerous and less structurally nuanced than subordinated compounds
but they too pose numerous problems at the level of semantic interpretation.
In particular, the identification of endocentric and exocentric items is often not
straightforward and requires an investigation of the use of individual compounds
in context. Consider the following typical examples:
6. Woman doctor: this may be interpreted to identify a doctor who is also a
     woman, or a woman who is also a doctor. It consequently has two heads,
     both placed on the same level, and this makes it an endocentric coordinated
     compound.
7. Mother-child: the two constituents make up a compound which is used as
     an adjective and describes the relationship between a mother and her child.
     The compound refers to an entity which lies outside the compound itself: it is
     therefore exocentric and has no heads.
Following the analysis proposed for (7), the compound Austro-Hungary should
also be interpreted as an exocentric compound, since it identifies something
other than Austria or Hungary alone. Yet even these textbook examples often
receive contrasting interpretations. Granted that woman doctor is endocentric, it
may be argued that the main idea is expressed by doctor alone and only modified
by woman: hence, the compound is subordinated, not coordinated. The question
is not easily settled and depends largely on pragmatics and semantic nuances:

only the context will clarify whether the emphasis is placed on both constituents
(‘woman and doctor’) or only on one of them. These issues are central to the inter-
pretation of coordinated compounds in AG as well (Chapter 2, section 2).
      In summary, the model adopted here identifies two main categories, subor-
dinated and coordinated compounds, based on the syntactic-semantic relation-
ship between the constituents. Each of these two categories is further divided into
endocentric and exocentric types. Table 1.1 shows all the primary combinations
with different lexical classes.

This model represents a simplified version of the model developed by Scalise and
Bisetto (2009). They also include a third category, termed ‘Attributive-Appositive
(ATAP)’ compounds and characterized by the fact that the non-head modifies the
head in the function of an attribute (as in swordfish) or an apposition (as in ape
man). However, ATAP compounds are not immediately distinguishable from sub-
ordinated compounds: they are still characterized by modification and described
in terms of head and non-head (in swordfish the head is fish). Scalise and Bisetto’s
main reason for separating ATAP compounds from subordinated compounds is
the fact that the non-head in the former often introduces a kind of metaphorical
modification. For instance, in swordfish the FC (the non-head) does not express
the notion that the fish is a sword, but rather that its bill looks like one.81
      The recognition that some compound constituents act as metaphorical mod-
ifiers is a valuable analytical tool, and one which proves particularly useful for
interpreting the AG material, since the metaphorical property of the FC is a fre-
quent characteristic of exocentric [N N]A compounds (e.g. ῥοδοδάκτυλος ‘having

rosy fingers’) and may well reflect an older IE tendency; this issue is discussed
in Chapter 2, section 5.4.82 However, for the purposes of classification the recog-
nition that modifiers may have a metaphorical function adds little to our under-
standing of the syntactic and morphological patterns of Greek compounds, e.g.
by predicting which stems will be used and where the constituents will be placed
within the compound, and in the case of other languages too it appears of limited
use. Attributive and appositive compounds can therefore be conveniently sub-
sumed under the macro-category of subordinated compounds.83
9 The classification of AG compounds: introductory issues
We are now equipped with the tools necessary to tackle the classification of the
compound types attested in AG in light of current treatments of compounding
and its properties. The next sections look at some of the issues involved in the
classification of Greek compounds, with a particular focus on how they have
been tackled in classic accounts of AG and IE compounding. Especially in the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, these accounts have often drawn from
Classical Sanskrit grammar for their description of compounding. We will con-
sider the advantages and drawbacks of these Sanskrit-inspired classifications
and highlight those issues which are also at the core of more recent debates on
compounding.
9.1 Classic approaches: from Sanskrit to Greek
As noted in section 4, the ancient Greek grammarians do not provide us with
their own classification of compounds, with the result that modern accounts
of Greek compounding, following the practice of nineteenth-century compar-
ative philologists, have often relied on the terminology used in Classical San-
skrit grammar, particularly under the influence of the great grammarian Pāṇini
(fifth-fourth century BC). In his grammatical masterpiece, the Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini
adopted a semantic approach for the classification of compounds. He distin-
guished between compounds in which the meaning is carried by both members
(a category identified with the compound dvandva ‘two-two’), those in which
it is carried by the SC (a category identified with the compound tatpuruṣa: ‘his
servant’), and those in which the meaning refers to an external entity (a category

identified with the compound bahuvrīhi ‘having much rice’).84 The category of
tatpuruṣas corresponds to the category of subordinate compounds which we have
considered above. Sanskrit grammars further subdivide the tatpuruṣas into three
subtypes: karmadhāraya compounds, in which the FC functions as a description
of the second (essentially [A N]N endocentric compounds); tatpuruṣas proper, in
which the FC functions as an oblique case, or attribute of the second (essentially
[N N]N and [N A]A endocentric compounds); and dvigu compounds, in which the
FC is a numeral (dvigu means ‘two cows’).85 In addition to these types, the San-
skrit grammarians isolated compounds characterized by the repetition of the
same form and conveying an idea of iteration (āmreḍita ‘repetition’). In summary,
Sanskrit was described as having six different compositional categories.86
      The classical Sanskrit classification does not identify a separate category
of verbal compounds, even though compounds displaying a verbal constituent
are extremely prominent in this language. The reason is precisely the semantic
approach adopted by the grammarians in their classification. Compounds with a
verbal constituent can be subsumed under the macro-category of subordinated
compounds, and this is what happens in the Sanskrit classification as well, par-
ticularly as concerns the extremely common types with a SC of verbal origin: they
are grouped together with the tatpuruṣas. The much less widespread Sanskrit
type with a verbal FC is addressed in Chapter 4, section 4.3.2, since its interpreta-
tion is debated (compounds of this type were sometimes classified with bahuvri-
his by the grammarians).
      The principles of Sanskrit classification informed the early modern
approaches to IE and Greek compounds.87 At the beginning of the twentieth
century, however, new criteria began to be adopted, eventually leading to the
abandonment of the Sanskrit terminology (only dvandva and bahuvrihi remain
common terms) and to the elaboration of a more formal approach, particularly
with regard to the category of tatpuruṣas.88 In volume 2.1 of the fundamental
Altindische Grammatik Wackernagel adopted the label Determinativkomposita
for the tatpuruṣas and described these determinative compounds starting from
84 Wackernagel (1905: 140). In the following discussion of Greek compounds I omit the macron
in the first i of bahuvrīhi when I use the word as a technical term, as is the practice among mor-
phologists (for the same reason, the word is mostly not italicized). The Aṣṭādhyāyī is edited and
commented by Renou (1966), Joshi and Roodbergen (1991–).
85 Dvigu must in fact be interpreted as a sub-class of bahuvrihis: see Wackernagel (1905: 140,
305).
86 Thus Salus (1965b: 40). On the origin of the Sanskrit terminology, see Sadovski (2002).

(2011: 31).

the formal analysis of the SC: verbal nouns, adjectives, and nouns of non-verbal
origin.89 Moreover, in the last sections of the volume Wackernagel discussed a
class which does not find a separate treatment in classical Sanskrit grammar:
compounds with a governing FC (which he termed Rektionskomposita ‘governing
compounds’). These were sub-divided into compounds with an adverbial/prepo-
sitional FC and compounds with a verbal FC.90
     In the same years, Karl Brugmann published a profoundly revised version
of vol. 2.1 of the Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen
Sprachen (1906), in which he introduced a modern terminology similar to Wacker-
nagel’s. IE compounds were now distinguished into iterative, copulative, verbal
governing (verbale Rektionskomposita), prepositional governing (präpositionale
Rektionskomposita), determinative and bahuvrihis. The last two categories were
identified on the basis of their endocentric and exocentric character respectively.91
     There is an important difference between Brugmann’s and Wackernagel’s
treatments. In the Altindische Grammatik, the verbale Rektionskomposita comprise
solely those compounds with a verbal FC, while those with a verbal SC remain part
of the Determinativkomposita (the Sanskrit tatpuruṣas). In Brugmann’s Grundriss,
on the other hand, the verbale Rektionskomposita comprise both compounds
with a verbal FC and compounds with a verbal SC.92 Brugmann’s approach to
the verbale Rektionskomposita is also followed in Ernst Risch’s Wortbildung der
homerischen Sprache (1937; 19742), which contains one of the clearest accounts
of Greek compounding up to the present. On the other hand, Albert Debrunner’s
Griechische Wortbildungslehre (1917) and Eduard Schwyzer’s Griechische Gram-
matik (1939), which continue Brugmann’s approach, only include V1 compounds
among the verbale Rektionskomposita, while compounds with a verbal SC are
treated together with determinative compounds.
9.2 Rektion, government, verbal nexus
The different terminologies and categorizations adopted in these classic studies
highlight the interpretative difficulties associated with the two major categories
of subordinated compounds, those with a verbal constituent and those with a

90 Wackernagel (1905: 308–321).
91 The introduction of new terms, in German, into the second edition of the Grundriss, may
perhaps be seen as another contribution of the Junggrammatiker Brugmann to the debate on IE
word-formation, on which see Chapter 3, section 5.

56          Chapter One – Compounding and the Classiication of Compounds
nominal head (determinative compounds). The term verbale Rektionskompos-
ita—just like its twin präpositionale Rektionskomposita—describes a situation
in which one of the compound constituents governs the other, as in the corre-
sponding syntactic phrases.93 While such a characterization applies unproblem-
atically to prepositional compounds, it is far from uncontroversial in the case of
verbal compounds: as noted by other scholars, on the whole compounds with a
verbal SC do not express a structure which is substantially different from the one
expressed by subordinated compounds in general.94 Of course, in syntax proper
there is a difference between government—which identifies ‘a kind of syntactic
linkage whereby one word (or word class) requires a specific morphological form
of another word (or class)’95—and subordination—which identifies a syntactic
structure in which a clause depends on another. In compounding this difference
is irrelevant, however, because the case-form which government selects in syntax
is deleted in the compounds. Consider the following examples from Greek, where
the case endings required by certain verbs or prepositions are replaced by suf-
fixes or compositional vowels in the corresponding compounds:
a. θεῷ εἴκελος ‘similar to a god’ ~ θεοείκελος: the dative case marker -ῷ is
      deleted (θεo- is the bare stem).
b. φέρειν οἶκον ‘to carry a house’ ~ φερέοικος: the accusative case marker -ον is
      replaced by the adjectival suffix -ος.
In basic terms, these two examples are formed according to a determiner-deter-
minatum relationship and it is therefore correct to classify them as subordinated
compounds (of the determinative kind). The case for distinguishing between
‘verbal governing’ compounds from ‘determinative’ compounds mostly rests
on the assumption that the verbal constituent in compounds such as φερέοικος
or κουροτρόφος is a verb, not a noun. This theoretical question is very similar
to that currently being discussed among morphologists apropos of synthetic
compounds.96 Section 6.1 discussed two possible interpretations of the structure
of synthetic compounds, which can equally be applied to a Greek V2 compound
such as κουροτρόφος:
a. A verbal stem is selected and compounded with a lexeme: [[κουρο]N
      [τρoφ]STEM]. The resulting form is provided with a derivational suffix which

      parallel structure for synthetic compounds was described as [[N VStem]er]N.
b. The compound is formed by joining two lexemes: [[κουρο]N[τροφός]N]N.
      Concerning English synthetic compounds, this structure was described
      as [N [Ner]]N. This second interpretation, which in section 6.1 was favoured
      for English synthetic compounds, makes the differentiation of a separate
      category of verbal governing compounds even more redundant.
The problem in the interpretation of κουροτρόφος and similar forms lies in the
nature of the SC itself, as discussed by Grandi and Pompei (2010: 212). While κου-
ροτρόφος corresponds to a simplex (τροφός ‘nurse’), many other compounds of
this kind seem to be formed with bound forms (i.e. there is no simplex attested in
the whole history of Greek): an example is the numerous group of compounds in
-ποιός ‘maker’ from ποιέω ‘make’, since ποιός does not occur as a separate word
in Greek. There is no easy way of resolving this question. In a corpus language
such as AG, there can be no certainty that the perceived lack of simplicia such as
**ποιός corresponds to reality. Moreover, the formation process of the simplicia
themselves is debated: some scholars claim that they are back-formations from
the compounds (Chapter 2, section 6.3.1). Even if we chose the label ‘verbal
governing’ on account of the bound nature of many SCs such as -ποιός, we would
still have to reckon with the many compound types which look and behave like
specializations of the simplicia (e.g. στράταρχος ‘army-leader’ vs. ἀρχός ‘leader’).
      The question is different in the case of compounds such as φερέοικος,
because here the verbal element cannot be taken to be a noun, at least not from a
synchronic point of view: this is arguable only for those of the τερψίμβροτος type,
which some scholars link to action nouns in -σις, e.g. τέρψις ‘delight’. However,
the nominal interpretation of the FC τερψι- and comparable forms (a fairly main-
stream view) poses several problems in terms of structure: τερψίμβροτος and the
likes would be left-oriented bahuvrihis, an otherwise very rare type in Greek (see
Chapters 3 and 4 on this question). As regards the φερέοικος type, regardless
of whether FCs such as φερε- are to be interpreted as stems or inflected verbal
forms, it would be hard to class these compounds as determinative. Still, they can
be subsumed under subordinated compounds, as in the classification of Scalise
and Bisetto (2009: 50), where the ‘verbal nexus’ category belongs to subordinated
compounds, or that of Grandi and Pompei (2010: 206).
      On account of the difficulties which have just been highlighted, I adopt a
classification in which Greek compounds with a verbal constituent are set apart
from determinative compounds: this is a purely formal distinction and does not
bear on the syntactic interpretation of the type, which I consider to be of the sub-

9.3 Endocentric and exocentric in the Greek compound system
Like many other languages, Greek has both endocentric and exocentric compounds.
This section looks at a number of examples which may serve to introduce the over-
view of compound types presented in Chapter 2. The Greek compound system
contains two immediately straightforward endocentric types: [N N]N determinative
compounds such as οἰνόπεδον ‘vineyard’ and [A N]N determinative compounds
such as ἀκρόπολις ‘high city’, which express subsets of the notions of ‘ground’
(-πεδον) and ‘city’ (-πολις) respectively. Other compound types may be considered
to be ambiguous as concerns their endocentric character, and this is because of
their primary or possible use as adjectives. Consider the following types:
a. κουροτρόφος ‘nurturer of boys’. In spite of the existence of the noun τροφός
     ‘nurse’ mentioned above, the compound is primarily used as an attribution
     or apposition, for instance of γυνή ‘woman’ or Ἑλλάς ‘Greece’. All V2 com-
     pounds of this kind, i.e. those characterized by the masculine/neuter suffix
     -ος/-ον, are liable to be used as adjectives.
b. Adjectival determinative compounds such as παμποίκιλος ‘all-variegated’, in
     which the SC corresponds to the simplex ποικίλος ‘variegated’.
Compounds such as the example in (a) display a modification in the morpholog-
ical class of their head element (-τροφος) when they are used as adjectives: this
is particularly evident when they are used in the neuter gender, in which the SC
assumes the form -τροφον. When compounds such as κουροτρόφος are used as
nouns, it is possible to run a semantic test to verify that they contain a head: to
‘is κουροτρόφος a type of τρoφός’ (or: is ‘nurse of children’ a type of ‘nurse’?) the
answer is ‘yes’, i.e. the compound is headed and endocentric. However, when
κουροτρόφος is used as an adjective, its focus lies outside it: the compound no
longer refers to a type of τρoφός, but to something else, e.g. a land or city.
     If we run another semantic test (is παμποίκιλος a type of ποικίλος? Or: is
‘all-variegated’ a type of ‘variegated’), we see that compounds such as the example
in (b) remain in the same morphological class as their head element: παμποίκιλος
is an adjective, just like its head ποικίλος.97 Regardless of the fact that adjectives,
97 On the usefulness of the semantic test, especially in the determination of headedness in
compounding, see Scalise (1992a: 183–184). Without such a semantic understanding of head,
the results can be confusing: see e.g. Barri (1975) for the idea that bahuvrihis are endocentric.

by nature status, refer to an external entity, παμποίκιλος is a subset of the idea of
ποικίλος.
     As already noted, endocentricity and exocentricity are not inherent proper-
ties of individual categories or forms, but arise from their use in context. Con-
sider for instance καλλίπαις [beautiful child] which Aeschylus and other poets
used with the possessive meaning ‘having beautiful children’ (exocentric deter-
minative, bahuvrihi), but which Euripides used with the meaning ‘beautiful
child’ (endocentric determinative: -παις is the head). The issue is also relevant
to the debate on the origin of determinative compounds and bahuvrihis in PIE
(Chapter 2, sections 4.7 and 5.2). Bahuvrihis such as ῥοδοδάκτυλος ‘with rosy
fingers’ (ῥόδον ‘rose’ + δάκτυλος ‘finger’) are formed exactly like other determi-
native compounds, except that they undergo a mutation of linguistic function,
becoming exocentric.98
     Prepositional compounds such as ἔφαλος ‘by the sea’ (ἐπί ‘on’ + ἅλς ‘sea’) are
always exocentric, since they are always used as adjectives and represent neither
a subset of the preposition (ἐπί) nor of the governed noun (ἅλς). Another common
exocentric category is the V1 type. As discussed in section 7.2 regarding cutpurse,
the semantic test shows that φερέοικος ‘carry-house, one who carries the house’
is neither a type of φέρειν ‘carry’ nor a type of οἶκος ‘house’. Moreover, the whole
compound expresses a morphological class which is different from that of its
left-hand element φερε- (whatever its origin) and further confirms that φερε- is
not the head of the compound, which is consequently not endocentric.99
     Some accounts of AG and early IE compounding tend to regard the creation
of endocentric compounds as a recent development in IE, part of what Hoenigs-
wald (1977) described as a more general ‘trend towards endocentricity’. Accord-
ingly, exocentric determinative compounds are considered to have arisen earlier
than endocentric determinative compounds.100 Two sets of proofs are adduced in
favour of this view. First, some exocentric determinatives are re-used as endocen-
tric ones: for instance καλλίπαις discussed above or ἄφιλος ‘without friends’, later
used in the endocentric meaning ‘unfriendly’, i.e. ‘one who is not a φίλος’ (cf. the
classic Vedic example rājá-putra- ‘having kings as sons’ vs. the endocentric deter-
minative rāja-ṕtra- ‘king’s son’: the difference is marked by the accent). Second,
there is the fact that endocentric determinatives seem to be rarer in early Greek.101
98 Lindner (2011: 25).
99 I adopt an interpretation which is different from that proposed in Tribulato (2006). The
headedness of V1 compounds is a controversial issue: it is tackled in more detail in Chapter 2,
section 7.5.3.

I will take up this issue again in Chapter 2, sections 4.7 and 5.2, where the view
that endocentric determinatives are rare in early Greek will be challenged.
9.4 Right-oriented and left-oriented compounds
The final criterion which is useful for a better understanding of Greek compound
types is the orientation of constituents. As noted, the Greek compound system is
predominantly right-oriented. In subordinated compounds, therefore, the deter-
minatum mostly occurs on the right, while the modifier mostly occurs on the left
(κουροτρόφος, ῥοδοδάκτυλος, etc.). In endocentric subordinated compounds the
determinatum also coincides with the head (ἀκρόπολις, etc.).
     There are two kinds of exceptions to the prevailing right-oriented orientation:
1. V1 compounds and prepositional compounds have the determinatum on the
     left. In φερέοικος ‘house-carrying’, φερέζυγος ‘yoke-bearing’, φερέκαρπος
     ‘fruit-yielding’ the FC remains the same, but its meaning is specified by the
     various SCs (compositional forms of οἶκος ‘house’, ζυγόν ‘yoke’ and καρπός
     ‘fruit’). Similarly, in ἔφαλος ‘on the sea’ and ἐπίγαιος ‘upon the earth’ the FC
     remains the preposition ἐπί and its meaning is specified by -αλος and -γαιος
     (compositional forms of ἅλς ‘sea’ and γαῖα ‘earth’).
2. Some endocentric and exocentric determinative compounds have or are
     interpreted to have the determinatum on the left (this coincides with the head
     in the endocentric types). In section 7.3 we considered the example of the [N
     N]N endocentric determinative compound ἱπποπόταμος, which is left-headed.
     Similarly, in the [A N]A determinative compound ἀξιόλογος ‘worthy of
     mention’ the FC is the stem of the adjective ἄξιος ‘worthy’ and its meaning
     is completed by the SC -λόγος ‘word, mention’: the compound is left-headed
     and endocentric. For the ambiguous status of other potentially left-oriented
     compounds (particularly left-oriented bahuvrihis), see Chapter 2, section 7.2.
The left-oriented types exemplified in (1) and (2) do not have the same weight in
the Greek compound system. Those under (1) are common and productive types,
which remain so at all stages of the language. Those under (2), on the other hand,
are self-contained sub-groups at best: this is the case with compounds in ἀξιο-,
and others with a limited number of adjectival heads, as well as some animal and
plant names with a substantival head (e.g. ἱπποπόταμος). Table 1.2 summarizes
all the compound types represented in the Greek compound system.102

10 Conclusion
The survey contained in this chapter has shown that compounding is far from
being a settled topic, defined by shared and immutable parameters. One advan-
tage of the on-going theoretical interest in the definition and analysis of com-
pounds cross-linguistically is that it prompts us to view some of the specific
characteristics of AG compounds in new perspectives and to update some of the
classic discussions of Greek compounding in the light of current research. In par-
ticular, the classification proposed in this chapter has paid attention to the issues
of headedness and orientation in compounding, which are of direct relevance to
the category of V1 compounds. In the next chapter, the description of the individ-
ual compound categories will be arranged according to the macro-categories of
coordinated and subordinated compounds, and hence of endocentric and exo-
centric types. This full analysis will set the stage for the study of the most promi-
nent left-oriented category of AG: V1 compounds.

The Compound Categories of Ancient Greek                                          Chapter Two – The Compound Categories of Ancient Greek
1 Introduction
Chapter 1 dealt with those features which characterize compounding from a
theoretical point of view and considered how the methodologies developed
for modern languages contribute to identifying the key issue of AG compound-
ing as well. Taking those theoretical premises as its starting point, this chapter
provides a full classification of AG compound types in the light of those topics
which are at the centre of current morphological debates, including headedness,
the nature of exocentricity, and compound orientation. The compound system
which emerges from this overview is a markedly right-oriented one which admits
a limited number of well-defined left-oriented categories. Sections 7.1–7.5 focus
on these left-oriented types in preparation for the analysis of the most common
variety, V1 compounds, an analysis to which the remainder of this study will then
be devoted.
2 Coordinated compounds
Coordinated compounds are forms in which all the constituents lie on the same
syntactic level and whose structure, therefore, is in direct contrast to that of
subordinated compounds. Most of the classic accounts of Greek compounding
either treat the question of whether Greek possesses coordinated compounds in a
cursory fashion,1 or omit it altogether.2 These accounts also tend to map Greek
coordinated compounds to the productive Sanskrit category from which the tech-
nical term dvandva (‘pair’) derives.
    According to the Classical Sanskrit classification, dvandvas are forms in
which all constituents have the same syntactic function and which are perceived
as a conceptual unity.3 The type developed in Sanskrit through a number of
stages. At first, only forms used in the dual were compounded, but they retained
their individual accents: the classic example is mitr-váruṇā ‘Mitra and Varuna’
(both constituents with dual ending). At a second stage, the FC began to appear
in a different form from the SC (often in the nominative or accusative) but both

constituents still retained their accent, e.g. mitr-váruṇayoḥ ‘of Mitra and Varuna’
(where the SC has the genitive ending, but the FC is still in the dual). Finally, the
compound acquired a single accent (e.g. indrā-pūṣṇóḥ ‘of Indra and Pūṣan’) and
the FC begun to appear in the simple stem (e.g. indra-vāy, where the FC is in the
simple stem: compare the form indrā- in the previous example).4 Side by side
with this original dvandva type, Vedic begun to develop another type of coordi-
nated compounds which denoted groups and collective entities: in these newer
forms, which are more numerous in Classical Sanskrit, the FC always employs
the bare stem, while the SC takes plural endings, as in ajā-váyas [goat sheeps]
‘goats and sheep’ (the [a:] in ajā- results from Kompositionsfuge of ajá- ‘goat’ and
vái- ‘sheep’).
2.1 Classification issues: endocentric and exocentric coordinated
2.1 compounds
Modern accounts of coordinated compounds criticize the application of the San-
skrit term dvandva to forms attested in a variety of modern languages. Typologi-
cal studies reveal that compounds which can be transformed into a coordinated
phrase do not all have the same semantic properties.5 The basic definition of
coordinated compounds as compounds in which ‘all constituents lie on the same
syntactic level or have identical status’ is admittedly very broad and, as a conse-
quence, insufficiently precise.6 This is reflected in the variety of different coordi-
nated structures described in the literature.7 We begin by listing those which also
find parallels in MG; the fact that coordinated compounds are well-represented in
that language suggests that their ancestry may extend back to AG.
1. Collective or hyperonymic coordinated compounds (also termed co-com-
      pounds). These refer to an entity/notion which is superordinate to the com-
      pound constituents: e.g. MG μαχαιροπήρουνα [knives forks] ‘cutlery’ (a com-
      parable form is the Mandarin compound dāo-qiāng [sword spear] ‘weapons’).8
      This is the type which is closest to the Classical Sanskrit class of dvandvas.

5 On the issue of terminology, see Arcodia, Grandi and Wälchli (2010: 178–184), Ralli (2013:

6 Arcodia, Grandi and Wälchli (2010: 177–178) discuss the ambiguities surrounding the concept
of ‘coordination’.

(2001), Wälchli (2005), Bauer (2008), Scalise and Bisetto (2009).

2.   Coordinating or hyponymic compounds. These refer to an entity/notion
     which is subordinated to one of the compound constituents, i.e. they rep-
     resent a subtype of one of the constituents: e.g. αρχιτέκτονας-αρχαιολόγος
     [architect archaeologist] ‘an archaeologist who is also an architect’. This type
     is common to many languages, e.g. woman doctor, Sp. lanza-espada [spear
     sword] ‘a spear with a blade’, etc.9
The guiding principle in the classification of these two types is semantic, since
there are no special features which set the first type apart from the second.
However, the examples under (1) are exocentric, while those under (2) are endo-
centric. According to the typological model proposed in Arcodia, Grandi and
Wälchli (2010), compounds of type (1) are the basic type of coordinated com-
pounds, while hyponymic endocentric coordinating compounds of type (2) are a
developed type only in the languages of Western and Central Europe.
     From a theoretical point of view, the question is whether the endocentric
compounds under (2) should be considered to have two heads—i.e. whether in
woman doctor both constituents add to the meaning of the entity designated by
the compound as a whole—or whether only one of them is a head. The question
does not receive a single answer in the literature, and individual examples too
receive contrasting interpretations.10 On account of these ambiguities, Olsen (2001:
284–286) chooses to define instances like woman doctor as ‘pseudo-dvandvas’.
2.2 Coordinated compounds in Greek
The long history of the Greek language makes it a valuable source of insights
in respect of this general issue. Greek seems to have moved from a situation in
which type (1) was rare and (2) comparatively common to a situation (MG) in
which (2) has limited attestation and (1) has become hugely productive. In AG, the
collective coordinated compounds of type (1) are used only as numeral forms, e.g.
δυώδεκα [two ten] ‘twelve’, which semantically expresses a superordinate notion
(twelve contains two and ten); or as adjectives such as γλυκύπικρος ‘bitter-sweet’
(this taste contains elements of bitter and sweet, but is something different from
both). It should be noted, however, that γλυκύπικρος might also be interpreted as
expressing a nuance of ‘bitter’, according to which the bitterness is accompanied

by hints of sweetness: as such, the compound would have an endocentric charac-
ter and fall within our type (2).
     Compounds belonging to (2) are more common in AG, e.g. ἰατρόμαντις [doctor
diviner], κλαυσίγελως [tear laughter] ‘laughter mingled with tears’, μηλοπέπων
[apple melon] ‘type of sweet melon (Cucumis melo)’ and ἱππαλεκτρυών [horse
cock] ‘gryphon’.11 However, in many of these cases, an analyst may choose either
to focus on the coordinated unit expressed by the compound, in which both con-
stituents have head status and which functions as an apposition of something
else, or to decide that there is only one semantic head (usually the SC) and that
these are endocentric determinative compounds.12
     Some AG coordinated compounds have become famous for their recursive
character, i.e. the accumulation of constituents (usually to the left). Such forms
seem to have been typical of comic style and often occur in contexts where a list
is being recited (usually of foods): a well-known example is the spellbinding λοπ
αδο-τεμαχο-σελαχο-γαλεο-κρανιο-λειψανο-δριμ-υποτριμ-ματο-σιλφιο-παραλο-με
λιτο-κατακεχυμενο-κιχλ-επικοσσυφο-φαττο-περιστερ-αλεκτρυον-οπτο-πιφαλλιδ
ο-κιγκλο-πελειο-λαγῳο-σιραιο-βαφη-τραγανο-πτερυγών in Ar. Eccl. 1169–1174,
where, together, the many stems identify a dainty dish containing all kinds of fish,
meat, fowl and sauces (giving us an exocentric coordinated compound). Comic
language also favours a special variety of determinative compound in which the
FC is itself a compound, and specifically a compound of the coordinated type:
see for instance σπερμ-αγοραιο-λεκιθο-λαχανό-πωλις [seed of common sort pulse
vegetable-seller]: ‘seller of seeds, cheap pulse and vegetables’ (Ar. Lys. 457), in
which the head is -πωλις ‘female seller’ and its modifier is the recursive coordi-
nated form σπερμ-αγοραιο-λεκιθο-λαχανό-. These long determinative compounds
continue to be found in popular strata of Medieval and Modern Greek.13 It was
probably this type that prompted Meyer’s statement that Greek ‘dvandvas’
belonged to ‘dem Munde des Volkes oder dem Geiste des Kunstdichters’, and were
not an inherited feature.14
     AG also has PNs of the coordinated type (2), such as Ἀρκολέων [bear lion],
Ἀρκόλυκος [bear wolf] and Λυκολέων [wolf lion].15 The semantic interpretation of
these names is open to debate: should Ἀρκολέων be understood as ‘he who IS a
lion and a bear at the same time’ (hence as an endocentric compound), or ‘he who
HAS a lion and a bear in himself’ (hence as an exocentric compound)? On a more

speculative level, the interpretation ‘he who IS a lion similar to a bear’ (giving
us a kind of endocentric determinative) is also defensible, though the resulting
meaning is less intuitively plausible.16
     As already noted, this coordinating hyponymic type (2) became increas-
ingly inconspicuous in the language: MG complies with the typological model
theorized by Arcodia, Grandi and Wälchli (2010), according to which type (1)
is the more common. The few examples of (2) in MG often have a special mor-
phological status, since they have a [word word] structure which goes against
the principle of stem compounding and also have two accents. Manolessou and
Tsolakidis (2009: 24–25) therefore maintain that loose multi-word forms like
αρχιτέκτονας-αρχαιολόγος ‘architect-archaeologist’ or παιδί-θαύμα ‘child-prod-
igy’ are modelled on French compounds and do not represent the continuation of
the old coordinating type.
     Examples of (1) such as γυναικόπαιδα ‘women and children’ (plural) seem
to have been introduced from Medieval Greek and are more common in modern
dialectal varieties than in standard MG.17 Type (1) also subsumes a typical feature
of standard MG, [V V] coordinated compounds such as κλοτσώ-πατώ [kick step
in] ‘kick and step in’.18
3 Iterative compounds
Sanskrit grammars include among coordinated compounds a subclass in which
an inflected word is repeated twice to convey the idea of iteration, e.g. Vedic
dáme-dame- ‘in every house’ (where -e is the locative ending) as opposed to
dáme ‘in the house’. The technical name given to these forms is āmreḍita (lit.
‘repetition’), but it should be noted that the word dvandva ‘pair’ is itself an iter-
ative compound. Iterative compounds with inflected constituents are also found
in Avestan and Armenian; outside the IE family, they have parallels in Malay.19
Cross-linguistically, however, iteratives with simple stems rather inflected con-
stituents are the most common variety.20
16 Risch (1944: 56–61) for instance calls these forms ‘Mischungskomposita’ and treats them
among determinative compounds.

68            Chapter Two – The Compound Categories of Ancient Greek
3.1 Iterative compounds in Greek
AG does not have an unequivocal category of iterative compounds and the inter-
pretation of individual forms is a matter of debate. Rare forms such as πάμπαν
[all all] ‘wholly’ may be interpreted as reiterations of full words (the adverbial
neuter πᾶν ‘wholly’) rather than stems.21 The picture becomes more interesting
once we probe the Mycenaean evidence. The Linear B tablets contain the com-
pounds we-te-i-we-te-i [year year] ‘every year’, in which both constituents clearly
display the locative ending, and a-mo-ra-ma [day day] ‘every day’, in which the
constituents are likely to be inflected in the accusative.22 a-mo-ra-ma finds a par-
allel in the adverb a-ma-ti-a-ma-ti [day day] ‘every day’, attested in the Cypriot
inscription ICS2 318: this form displays the dative singular of ἇμαρ, ἅμαρτος ‘day’
(Attic-Ionic ἧμαρ) in both constituents.23
      These three forms, which have clear parallels in Sanskrit, Avestan and Arme-
nian, suggest that iterative compounds may have been inherited from PIE but
lost in most varieties of Greek. Since a-ma-ti-a-ma-ti is the only example of an
iterative compound dating from first-millennium Greek, one might speculate that
it represents an ‘Achaean’ relic.24 It is perhaps just a coincidence, but the Cypriot
and the Mycenaean examples are both found in the context of accountancy doc-
uments. a-ma-ti-a-ma-ti appears twice on side B of a sixth-century BC ostrakon
(ICS2 318), containing a list of offerings consisting in jars of wine.25 The Myce-
naean tablet PY Es 644, containing we-te-i-we-te-i, deals with tributes of wheat,
while tablet KN Am 660, containing a-mo-ra-ma, deals with a list of personnel. It
may be speculated that such crystallized expressions survived as part of the
lexicon typical of accountancy texts.
tition or distribution. Moreover, in the MG type λίγο-λίγο both constituents are accented, so that
it is unclear whether these forms ought to be considered true compounds in the first place. See
Ralli (2013: 39–42), who suggests that this type of doubling in Greek was the result of contact
with Turkish. Cf. also Manolessou and Tsolakidis (2009: 24).
21 For examples of iteration outside compounding, see Debrunner (1950: 700).
22 The form may derive from *āmr̥-āmr̥, yielding two different outcomes of *r̥ according to its
position within the word: for this and other interpretations, see Meissner and Tribulato (2002:
316–317).
23 See Egetmeyer (2010: 306) and Egetmeyer (1992) s.v. for further references on this form.
24 ‘Achaean’ is a conventional term to refer to the 2nd-millennium common ancestor of a num-
ber of Greek dialects.

4 Subordinated compounds
In subordinated compounds, the constituents do not lie on the same syntactic
level, insofar as one of them specifies, restricts or modifies the idea conveyed
by the other. When the determinatum represents a hyperonym of the meaning
expressed by the whole compound, it also constitutes the head of the compound,
which is therefore endocentric. This typology applies to determinative com-
pounds proper and to most verbal compounds. When no constituent fulfils this
function, the compound is headless, or exocentric. This typology applies to pos-
sessive compounds (bahuvrihis), V1 compounds and prepositional compounds.
Both typologies include right-oriented and left-oriented groups. Right-oriented
compounds are more numerous in AG and will be tackled first.
4.1 Right-oriented endocentric determinative compounds in Greek
Endocentric determinative compounds include the majority of compounds
attested in modern European languages. According to the most common config-
uration, the determiner occurs on the left and the head, specified by the deter-
miner, on the right (type school teacher), whereas left-headed languages display
the opposite structure (e.g. It. capostazione ‘stationmaster’, in which capo is the
head). As noted in Chapter 1, section 9.1, traditional accounts of IE compound-
ing treat determinative compounds according to the Sanskrit subdivision into
tatpuruṣas, in which the modifier has the function of a case (e.g. the locative or
the genitive, as in AG οἰνόπεδον ‘vineyeard’, literally meaning ‘ground of wine’),
and karmadhārayas, in which the modifier describes the SC in an attributive rela-
tionship (e.g. ἀκρόπολις ‘high city’). Such a syntactic-semantic subdivision of
the notion of determination is now generally abandoned in favour of a formal
description of the constituents, which splits determinative compounds into those
with a substantival head and those with an adjectival head.26
     Determinative compounds with a substantival head are by far the most
common in Greek and can be further subdivided according to the type of modifier:
noun (as in οἰνόπεδον: determiner from οἶνος ‘wine’), adjective (as in ἀκρόπολις:
determiner from ἄκρος ‘high’), preposition (as in πρόσοδος ‘entrance’: the deter-
miner is the preposition πρός ‘towards’), or prefixoid (as in δυσμήτηρ ‘bad moth-
er’).27 Determinative compounds as a whole are the least common category in the
26 Lindner (2011: 31).

sic accounts of Greek compounding contrasts with current morphological theory, according to

Linear B tablets and their development in early Greek is debated.28 We will return
to this issue after our overview of the various subtypes.
4.2 [N N]N endocentric determinative compounds
According to Risch (1944), determinative compounds with a substantival FC are
not fully developed in Ηomeric Greek, representing either relics from older lin-
guistic stages (the case of δεσπότης = Myc. do-po-ta ‘lord of the house’, whose FC
is a fossilized genitive no longer attested in Greek) or kinship terms (μητροπάτωρ
‘mother’s father, maternal grandfather’, πατροκασίγνητος ‘father’s brother,
paternal uncle’, etc.). In Mycenaean, definite examples of this type are very
rare and include the much-discussed theophoric epithets si-to-po-ti-ni-ja ‘Lady
of grain’ (cf. Σιτώ in Sicily) and a-ne-mo-i-je-re-ja ‘Lady of the wind’.29 Homeric
Greek also contains other isolated forms, including δημογέρων ‘elder of the
people’, ψευδάγγελος ‘false messenger’ (lit. ‘messanger of lies’), etc. The oldest
layers of Vedic match Risch’s description of Homeric Greek.30
     In later archaic texts [N N]N endocentric determinative compounds are
attested in greater numbers. Forms such as μελίλωτος ‘melilot’ (a fruit), used by
Sappho, or κοκκύμηλον ‘plum’ (lit. ‘plum-apple’, ‘fruit of the plum’), used by Hip-
ponax, indicate that the type was more developed in common language, a trend
which again corresponds to what we find in the more recent layers of the Vedic
poems.31 Epigraphic sources of the Archaic and Classical periods confirm that
[N N]N determinative compounds soon became both more widespread and more
numerous than those with an adjectival FC.32
     In this context, special attention should be paid to a subclass which
will be useful for the investigation of AG verbal compounds, that of the type
Ἑλλησποντοφύλαξ lit. ‘guardian of the Hellespont’ (Athenian customs official
who controlled trade in the Hellespont) and ψευδάγγελος ‘false messenger’. The
SCs -φύλαξ ‘guardian’ and -άγγελος are nouns which create popular denominative
verbs, φυλάσσω ‘to guard’ and ἀγγέλλω ‘to announce’. Similar forms are κῆρυξ
‘herald’ > κηρύσσω ‘to be a herald, to proclaim’, μάντις ‘prophet’ > μαντεύομαι
which forms in δυσ- and negative ἀ- (which are prefixes) are not compounds, but derivations.
The issue and its implications in the linguistic debate are discussed by Amado Rodríguez (1998:
97–98), Grandi and Pompei (2010: 216).

‘to divine’, ποιμήν ‘herdsman’ > ποιμαίνω ‘to herd’. The compounds containing
these nouns in their SC are therefore nominal rather than verbal, but the seman-
tic overlap with V2 compounds is high, and the structure of both categories is
identical; as we will see in Chapter 6, section 5, this fact may have some relevance
for the formal definition of a part of V2 compounds in Greek.
4.3 [A N]N endocentric determinative compounds
The picture we gain of determinative compounds with an adjectival modifier in
early Greek is a confusing one. According to Risch (1944), adjectival modifiers
were more common than substantival ones in early poetic Greek: he draws atten-
tion to those in κακο-, e.g. Κακοίλιος ‘unhappy Ilios’ (which finds a semantic par-
allel in prefixed forms with δυσ- such as δυσμήτηρ ‘bad mother’ and Δύσπαρις
‘unhappy Paris’) and to ethnonyms such as Πανέλληνες ‘all the Hellenes’. Forms
of πᾶς, particularly in the adverbial form παν-, are common in determinative com-
pounds of the Archaic period: see for instance παμβασιλεύς ‘absolute monarch’,
used by Alcaeus.
     From among the categories which developed in the Classical and Hellenis-
tic periods, Risch (1949) singles out compounds in -πολις which (perhaps based
on the model of ἀκρόπολις) are typically compounded with adjectival FCs: e.g.
νεόπολις ‘new city’, μεγαλόπολις ‘great city’, Καλλίπολις ‘beautiful city’, etc. In
general, however, most of the new determinatives are of the [N N]N type: this ten-
dency is also confirmed by the epigraphic evidence, where adjectival FCs are not
numerous.33 The development of this type of determinatives has not been studied
in earnest: such a study is a desideratum in the field of AG compounding.
4.4 [P N]N endocentric determinative compounds
An often neglected type of determinative compound is that in which the head
is modified by a preposition/adverb, e.g. ὑφηνίοχος ‘(subordinated) chariot-
eer’ (Hom.), i.e. an ἡνίοχος who is ὑπό ‘below’ someone else. The literary and
epigraphic evidence reveals that this type was well-developed in Classical Attic,
where we find forms such as ξυνγραμματεύς ‘joint-secretary’ (i.e. a γραμματεύς
who is ξύν ‘together with’ someone else), συμπρύτανις ‘joint-prytanis’ (i.e. a
πρύτανις who is σύν ‘together with’ another), πρόσοδος ‘approach, entrance’ (i.e.

72           Chapter Two – The Compound Categories of Ancient Greek
an ὁδός which leads πρός ‘towards’), etc.34 The type of determinative compound
with a prepositional or adverbial modifier continues into MG, with examples such
as πανο-τόκι ‘top interest’ and εξό-πορτα ‘outer door’.
     These early endocentric examples show that AG was quick to employ a vast
range of lexical categories for the formation of determinative compounds, some-
thing which appears to support the hypothesis that Greek developed a ‘trend
towards endocentricity’ (see section 4.6). In particular, post-Classical Greek was
marked by a proliferation of the [P N]N type indicating individuals and professions,
probably because of the need for more, and more accurate, terms to describe the
officers involved in the administration of the vast Hellenistic and Roman Greek
world, and perhaps also in connection with the expansion of scientific language,
which required transparent terminology. This expansion of [P N]N forms was only
part of a huge increase in the number of terms for professions and official titles,
among which we may mention those with the verbal FC ἀρχι- (which has acquired
the function of a prefix meaning ‘chief’; see Chapter 6, section 3.1), e.g. ἀρχιερεύς
‘chief-priest’; those with the adjectival FCs πρωτο-, e.g. πρωταγωνιστής ‘first
actor’, and ἀριστο-, such as the honorary title ἀριστοπολιτευτής ‘best citizen’; and
various translations of Latin terms, such as δυάνδρες = duumviri and ἀντιταμίας
= proquaestor.35
4.5 [Num N]N endocentric determinative compounds
This is a self-contained but relatively productive type. Some compounds in ἡμι-,
probably influenced by the bahuvrihi type (see section 5.3), are determinative: see
e.g. ἡμίονος ‘half-mule’ (already Myc.). In Classical Greek, compounds with τρι-
‘thrice’ have their own line of development, because they represent emphatic sub-
types of their heads: see for instance τρίδουλος ‘thrice a slave’ (Soph.), τριγέρων
34 The status of Mycenaean forms such as pe-ra-a3-ko-ra-i-ja ‘Further Province’ and de-we-ro-a3-
ko-ra-i-ja ‘Hither Province’ is ambiguous. The FCs are the locative adverbs πέρας and δεῦρο,
which may have a role comparable to the one of prepositions, but the compoundhood of the
forms is disputed: see Meissner and Tribulato (2002: 313). According to De Angelis and Gasbarra
(2010: 162) early determinative compounds with a prepositional FC were ‘creazioni espressive,
probabilmente poetiche, la cui natura di composti sembrerebbe piuttosto secondaria’. In these
compounds, the preposition—originally an apposition—would have progressively lost its auton-
omous status, so that the compounds would have been reanalysed as prepositional rather than
determinative. The authors however are mistaken in thinking that this type of determinative
compounds is rare and residual: on the contrary, as noted, it shares in the same expansion of
usage which affects determinative compounds in post-Classical Greek more generally.

‘triply old, very old’ (Aesch.).36 The same structure is probably displayed by the
Mycenaean title ti-ri-se-ro-e /tris-hērōei/ (dat.) ‘thrice hero’. Adjectives derived
from numerals are found in τριτοπάτωρ ‘great-grandfather’, πρᾱτομηνία ‘new
moon’ (Doric), τριτημόριον ‘third part’, etc.
4.6 [P A]A, [A A]A and [N A]A endocentric determinative compounds
As noted, the head of Greek determinative compounds may also be an adjective.
In this case the whole compound represents a nuance of the main idea expressed
by the adjective, which can be modified by a preposition, a prefix or, more rarely, a
noun. Prepositional FCs are the most common: they express a degree of the adjec-
tival idea, as in ὑπέρυθρος ‘reddish’ vs. ἐρυθρός ‘red’, or a locative specification
of the head, as in ἀμφιδέξιος ‘ambidextrous’ (literally ‘dexterous at both sides’)
vs. δεξιός ‘dexterous’. The type is already attested in the Mycenaean adjective
ku-su-pa = σύμπας ‘all together’. Adjectival FCs fulfil a similar adverbial function,
as in παγχρύσεος ‘wholly golden’, and are already found in the Mycenaean PNs
pa-na-re-jo = Παν-άρειος ‘all martial, all devoted to Ares’ and pa-di-jo = Πάνδιος
‘all divine, all devoted to Zeus’.
     Adjectival determinatives too have not been fully investigated from a dia-
chronic perspective, and we still rely on the cursory treatment of Risch (1944:
30–34) and Risch (1974: 213–214). Risch observes that in Homeric Greek only six
adjectival determinative compounds are of the [N A]A type. These are ἐγχεσίμωρος
‘mad for/with the spear’ (an adjective describing warriors who ‘rage with the
spear’), ὑλακόμωρος ‘mad for barking, always barking’, πόδαργος ‘swift at the
feet’, ἀρηΐφιλος ‘dear to Ares, martial’, κορυθαιόλος ‘swift/glittering as concerns
the helmet’ (another adjective describing warriors) and θεοείκελος ‘god-like’.
From a semantic point of view, these FCs further define the area of application of
the adjectival heads. The presence of what looks like a dative plural in the FC of
ἐγχεσίμωρος is consistent with the supposition that the compound derives from a
syntactic phrase, from which it inherits the case governed by the adjective μωρός
‘fool’.37
     A similar syntactic interpretation is likely to apply to all the other examples in
which the FC can be seen to carry out the function of dative of limitation or accu-
sative of respect in the underlying syntactic phrases. ἀρηΐφιλος, κορυθαιόλος and
θεοείκελος all manifest a degree of interference from syntactic phrases, be it the
presence of an inflected FC (ἀρηΐφιλος), the odd semantics (κορυθαιόλος works

better if we understand it to mean ‘glittering/colourful at the helmet’, with the FC
carrying out the function of an old accusative of respect, rather than ‘moving the
helmet quickly’, as in LSJ);38 or the presence of similar syntagms in the Homeric
poems (θεοείκελος, which in two cases refers to Achilles, has a parallel in the fre-
quent line-end vocative θεοῖς ἐπιείκελ’ Ἀχιλλεῦ ‘o Achilles, similar to the gods’).
As for πόδαργος, which is often discussed as the typical ‘reversed bahuvrihi’ (i.e.,
a left-oriented bahuvrihi), it may may well derive from the phrase πόδ’ ἀργός, in
which the adjective is restricted by the accusative of respect πόδα (see the fuller
discussion in section 4.6.1 concerning the development of adjectival determina-
tive compounds in Greek).
      Other types of evidence can serve to support the hypothesis that the com-
pounding of adjectives with substantival modifiers was not a fully developed
linguistic process in early Greek, a hypothesis which is consistent with the fact
that the Homeric nucleus of this compound type seems to have a pronounced
syntactic origin.39 The first piece of evidence is the continuing lack of substanti-
val modifiers in the compounded adjectives attested in later Greek: the modifiers
of compounded adjectives continue to be prepositions or other adjectives used
adverbially (the [P A]A and [A A]A types described above). Among these adjecti-
val modifiers, some of the most common are παν-, ὀλιγο-, μεγαλο-, μικρο- and
ἀκρο-, i.e. spatial modifications which express degrees along the scale of the
meaning conveyed by the adjective. Modifiers which specify the adjectival head
more accurately, for instance by expressing the area to which it is limited (as in
the English examples skin-tight, garden-fresh and care-free), are still the excep-
tion in Classical and post-Classical Greek. When they do occur, they all tend to
modify adjectives which express abstract qualities, such as friendship and love
(e.g. παιδόφιλος ‘loving children’), folly (e.g. γαστρίμαργος ‘mad for the stomach,
gluttonous’ in Pindar and δορίμαργος ‘mad for/with the spear’ in Aeschylus) and
value (e.g. δουλοπόνηρος ‘bad like a slave’s’, qualifying a fig of low quality in
Teleclides).
      There may be a degree of convergence here with the typological model devel-
oped by Dixon (1982), which divides adjectives into the universal semantic catego-
ries of Dimension, Physical Property, Colour, Human Propensity (e.g. happy), Age,
Value (e.g. good) and Speed.40 In English, no members of the classes Dimension,
38 Following Herodian’s interpretation (3.1.228.12–13 Lentz: see Chapter 1, section 4.4), the
meaning of the compound is connected by LSJ and most of the literature to the idea of ‘moving
fast’ (αἰόλλω), but αἰόλος may be better understood as conveying an idea of ‘diversity in colour’:

Colour, Age and Speed seem to take the prefix un- (that is, they cannot be negated
by means of a compound form).41 These categories typically express semantic
opposition through antonymic pairs: the opposite of large is not **unlarge but
another word, e.g. small. By contrast, Value and Human Propensity allow a great
number of un- constructions. This can be attributed to the fact that these adjecti-
val categories have less clear-cut semantics, so that the opposite of a word is not
always appropriately expressed by another. Antonymic pairs are found for some
basic meanings (e.g. good and bad, as opposed to **ungood), but polite is negated
by both rude and impolite, demonstrating that polite and rude are not perceived to
be the exact opposite of each other, as bad and good are.
     Dixon is not concerned with compounded adjectives in particular, but it is
interesting to note that in English it seems to be possible for all his categories
to be compounded with another noun: see mile-long (Dimension), skin-tight and
garden-fresh (Physical Property), red-brown (Colour), care-free (Human Propen-
sity), weeks-old (Age), snail-slow (Speed).42 However, adjectives conveying funda-
mental attributes, particularly in the Value class (good, bad, proper), are usually
not compounded, and many which indicate abstract qualities (Human Propen-
sity) are likewise rarely compounded with modifying nouns (see e.g. jealous,
kind, clever, generous, happy, cruel).
     The Greek restriction on the development of a productive class of endocentric
[N A]A compounds most likely constitutes proof that the trend towards endocen-
tricity was not fully developed in Greek. The fact that the few compounded adjec-
tives of this type belong to the class identifying abstract qualities may indicate
that the restriction was breached in the case of adjectives indicating non-physical
qualities, perhaps because of their potential semantic blurriness. This is not the
place to test this hypothesis thoroughly, but it may be worthwhile to undertake a
comprehensive analysis of Greek compounded adjectives from the point of view
of their semantic typology.

The preceding outline of the categories of determinative compounds lays the
ground for a number of concluding comments which need to be made before we
can proceed to the analysis of other compound classes. On the whole, determina-
tive compounds comprised the least common compound category in Mycenaean

and Archaic Greek, but over the history of the language their number increased
considerably.43 The paucity of determinatives in early Greek is seen as an inher-
ited feature, and part of the late development of endocentricity in the IE family.44
     However, it is important to remember that the documentation for early Greek
is biased towards literary evidence. There is a greater tendency for the elevated
language of poetry in particular to feature epithets, and these are by defini-
tion adjectives and usually exocentric compounds. In his investigation of the
connection between compounding and literary style, G. Meyer (1923: 35) noted
that determinative compounds were distinctive of the ‘descriptive’ style, typical
of prose and less heightened parts of poetry. An investigation of determinative
compounds occurring in Archaic and Classical inscriptions shows that this type
becomes increasingly common over the first centuries of the history of Greek,
acquiring a role that cannot be appreciated solely from the study of Archaic poetic
language.45 The development of determinative compounds observed in post-Clas-
sical Greek therefore has its roots in earlier stages of the language and should not
be seen as a sudden blooming.
     Moreover, if the notion of endocentricity is extended to a large portion of V2
compounds, then it emerges that the oldest stages of Greek already possessed a
large number of endocentric types: V2 agent nouns are particularly common in
Mycenaean Greek (see sections 6.3.2 and 6.4.1). The Classical Greek compound
system is therefore endocentric to a far greater extent than usually acknowledged
in classic accounts of AG compounding. The only endocentric category which
remains limited is that comprised of [N A]A determinative compounds, and this
is the result of what seems to have been a restriction on substantival modifiers of
adjectives, a characteristic which contrasts with freer situations such as that rep-
resented by Modern English. The Greek evidence, paired with the data from other
ancient IE languages, may well prove that the compounding of adjectives was a
later addition in IE as a whole, but this obviously needs further investigation.46
     The factors influencing the increase of determinative compounds in AG have
not been investigated in a systematic fashion. However, certain suggestions raised
in the works of scholars who have tackled various classes of endocentric com-
pounds in IE offer a promising starting point for further analysis. Frisk, discuss-
ing [A N]N determinative compounds (ἀκρόπολις, γλυκύμαλον), compares them to
the common Sanskrit type in which an adjectival modifier is compounded with a
verbal SC, e.g. pūrva-gátvan- ‘going to meet’ (in which the FC pūrva- is an adjec-

tive meaning ‘previous’).47 Frisk does not take this point further, but the implica-
tion may be that V2 compounds exerted an influence on the formation of determi-
native compounds, which were rare in Vedic.
     This intuition is more explicitly developed by Risch, who notes that some
AG adjectival determinatives have the meaning of a participle and may have
been influenced by V2 compounds.48 Similarly, Risch ascribes the rise of deter-
minative compounds in ἡμι- (e.g. ἡμίονος ‘mule’) to the influence, at the PIE
stage, of compounded participles, a type later represented by e.g. Skt. sāmí-cita-
‘half-piled’. According to this model, therefore, FCs compounded with verbal
SCs were extended to nominal SCs: a case in point is the spread of the negative
prefix ἀ- from V2 compounds such as ἄελπτος ‘unexpected’ or ἄζυξ ‘unyoked’ to
adjectival determinatives such as ἀμείλιχος ‘implacable’ vs. μείλιχος ‘kind’. Note
that ἀμείλιχος is the nominal variant of the verbal passive adjective ἀμείλικτος
‘unsoftened’ (from μειλίσσω ‘to soften’). Determinative compounds drew exten-
sively on other compound categories as well. As Risch (1944: 37–38) notes, the
spread of the negative prefix ἀ- to substantival determinatives resulted from the
semantic reanalysis of some bahuvrihis, leading to the reinterpretation of ἄξενος
‘having no guests’ (Hes. Op. 715) and ἄφιλος ‘having no friends’ (Soph. Phil.
1018) as endocentric formations meaning ‘inhospitable’ (Eur.) and ‘unfriendly’
(Aesch.) respectively. The combined influence of V2 and possessive compounds
therefore gave rise to a whole range of non-verbal negative adjectives in Classical
and post-Classical Greek.49 In general, many substantival and adjectival determi-
natives have FCs which were earlier used in other categories of compounds, and
many subtypes develop out of the reanalysis of older classes: as we have seen, the
V1 compound ἀρχιερεύς changes its meaning from ‘person who commands the
priests’ to ‘chief-priest’ (determinative structure), while the prepositional deter-
minative ὑφηνίοχος ‘(sous-) charioteer’ may originally have had a prepositional
exocentric structure, indicating ‘someone who is under the charioteer’.

that entity. The term ‘bahuvrihi’ derives from the Sanskrit grammatical tradition:
since it identifies someone or something which ‘has much rice’, it has become a
common label for possessive compounds. ‘Bahuvrihi’ should therefore always be
used to mean ‘possessive’ rather than—as is not infrequently the case in modern
accounts of compounding—‘exocentric’ in general.50 It should also not be used to
refer to V1 or prepositional compounds, both of which are exocentric categories
but do not express a possessive notion.
     Greek and Sanskrit make extensive use of this inherited pattern, which seems
to have become marginalized in modern IE languages: while the rarity of bahuvr-
ihis in Romance perhaps conforms to the overall restriction on compounding in
this branch, the small numbers in English, German and Irish are more striking.51
In general, in all these languages bahuvrihis mostly survive as denominations
(PNs, surnames, nicknames, toponyms), a tendency manifested also by MG (see
section 5.3).52
5.1 Structure, suffixes and accent
The classic handbook example of a Greek bahuvrihi is the Homeric epithet of
Dawn ῥοδοδάκτυλος ‘having rosy fingers’: the FC derives from ῥόδον ‘rose’ and
modifies the SC δάκτυλος ‘finger’ by indicating its physical characteristics (argu-
ably a rosy colour and softness). The compound is determinative, but it does not
indicate a type of finger: its reference point (in this case Dawn) lies outside the
constituents. ῥοδοδάκτυλος is therefore an exocentric compound whose adjecti-
val function is conveyed by the suffix -ος (masc./fem.), -ον (neut.). The adjectival
status of ῥοδοδάκτυλος is ambiguous in that the adjective ῥοδοδάκτυλος is identi-
cal to the simple noun δάκτυλος, so that the adjectival function is not immediately
identifiable on formal grounds. The adjectival nature of ῥοδοδάκτυλος emerges,
however, once we consider that the masculine form is also used to modify nouns
of feminine gender, as in the Homeric formula ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς ‘rosy-fingered
Dawn’, where Ἠώς is a feminine noun. In other bahuvrihis the adjectival suffix

(1992), Villalva (1992). For Germanic languages, see Carr (1939), Marchand (1969: 13–14, 386–389),
Becker (1992). Old Irish bahuvrihis are discussed by Uhlich (1993: 115–117). Note that this cate-
gory does not subsume exocentric compounds as a whole, which according to some accounts
are a typologically common category: see Scalise, Fábregas and Sforza (2009: 50, 81–82), Lieber
(2009a). There are divergent views, however: Dressler (2006) for instance considers exocentric
compounds less common, while Bauer (2010: 174) draws attention to their ‘remnant-like status’.

attached to the SC is more transparent. Consider for instance πολύανδρος ‘of many
men, full of men’ and ἀγριόφωνος ‘with rough voice’: the SCs -ανδρος and -φωνος
derive from the stems ἀνδρ- of ἀνήρ ‘man’ and φων- of φωνή ‘voice’ respectively,
to both of which the adjectival suffix -ος is attached.
     The modification of the substantival SC through an adjectival suffix is there-
fore the first marker of Greek bahuvrihis.53 From a morphological point of view,
the suffix signals that the SC has changed morphological class.54 -ος is the most
common suffix in SCs derived from first- and second-declension stems, but it
is also found with a variety of consonantal third-declension stems (as e.g. in
μελάνυδρος ‘having black water’ vs. ὕδωρ ‘water’ or ἄπυρος ‘without fire’ vs.
πῦρ ‘fire’). Another common suffix is -εσ- (-ης in the nom. sg. masc./fem.), which
serves to derive adjectives from s-stem nouns, as in πολυανθής ‘with many flow-
ers’.55 Other third-declension stems may be left unaltered, e.g. λεύκασπις ‘with a
white shield’ (< ἀσπίς ‘shield’) and χαλκεοθώρηξ ‘with brazen corslet’ (< θώρηξ
‘corslet’).
     The second marker of Greek bahuvrihis is their tendency to bear the accent on
the FC.56 Among the examples just quoted, πολύανδρος, ἀγριόφωνος, μελάνυδρος,
ἄπυρος and λεύκασπις comply with this rule, but πολυανθής, χαλκεοθώρηξ
and the paradigm itself ῥοδοδάκτυλος do not. In the case of χαλκεοθώρηξ and
ῥοδοδάκτυλος, this is because of the Greek ‘three-syllable rule’: the accent
cannot go beyond the antepenultimate syllable and so ῥοδοδάκτυλος cannot be
accented **ῥοδόδακτυλος. The antepenult may be accented if the last syllable is
short (as in ῥοδοδάκτυλος), but the accent must fall on the penultimate if the last
syllable is long: this is the case for χαλκεοθώρηξ, which could not be accented
**χαλκεόθωρηξ. In πολυανθής, on the other hand, the typical bahuvrihi accentu-
ation is overridden by the rule governing so-called ‘Caland compounds’, which
seem to have been prototypically accented on the SC.57
53 See Hirt (1928: 40) and, for Sanskrit, Wackernagel (1905: 101–102).
54 For this reason, some older accounts also call bahuvrihis ‘mutata’: among them, see Brug-
mann (1906: 75).
55 This suffix is part of the ‘Caland system’, on which see Risch (1974: 218–219), Meissner (2006:
161–165) and Chapter 1, section 4.1.
56 Cf. Brugmann (1906: 115). Exceptions to this rule in Vedic and Greek are discussed by Melazzo
and Melazzo (2010).
57 In -ης compounds the most frequent oxytone accentuation (as in πολυανθής) is probably
more recent than the residual paroxytone accentuation (e.g. θρασυμήδης ‘having bold plans’):
see Meissner (2006: 200–201).

5.2 The relationship between bahuvrihis and determinative compounds
The recognition that accentuation of the FC is typical of bahuvrihis has led schol-
ars to assign other compound categories which display this feature to the bahu-
vrihi class. For instance, passive V2 compounds with an o-grade stem in the SC
(ὀρεσίτροφος ‘reared on mountains’, see section 6.3.1) are commonly interpreted
as deriving from reanalysed bahuvrihis. This development would involve a first
stage in which a possessive compound is formed with a nomen rei actae (in this
case, τροφή ‘nourishment > ὀρεσίτροφος ‘having his nourishment on mountains’)
followed by a second stage in which the formal identity between the mutated SC
-τροφος and the SC of agentive verbal compounds (κουροτρόφος ‘rearing chil-
dren’) causes the compound to be semantically reinterpreted as ‘reared on moun-
tains’. The accent on the FC, which is the marker of these passive compounds
and sets them apart from the active variety, would thus be inherited from the old
bahuvrihi pattern.
      Similarly, V2 compounds such as πολέμαρχος ‘war-lord’ have been inter-
preted as former bahuvrihis containing a verbal noun (in this case, ἀρχή ‘power’),
later reanalysed as a nomen agentis.58 Certainly, the group of compounds with an
agentive SC is too vast to justify the conclusion that they all arose from possessive
structures, but a bahuvrihi origin would help to explain a number of problematic
issues concerning the Greek agent nouns and their compounds (see section 6.3.1).
J. Schindler proposed a similar explanation to account for the structure of the
Greek V1 compounds such as τερψίμβροτος; they derive, in his view, from pos-
sessive compounds containing nomina actionis in -σις (τέρψις ‘delight’) in the FC
(on this hypothesis, which the present study rejects, see Chapter 4 section 4.3.1).
      The relationship between bahuvrihis and endocentric determinative com-
pounds too has long been debated by scholars. Some accounts take bahuvrihis to
be typical of the oldest stages of PIE, in which inflections had not yet been devel-
oped.59 More recently, the supposed antiquity of bahuvrihis has been adduced in
support of the theory that endocentricity was a later development in PIE and the
58 Brugmann (1906: 116).
59 See e.g. Hirt (1928: 40): ‘Die Bahuvrihi stammen, wie wir wohl heute mit Sicherheit sagen
dürfen, aus der flexionslosen Epoche des Idg.’ and Jacobi (1897: 87–94). This interpretation of
bahuvrihis follows the view of the development of PIE from a primordial isolating stage to its
final inflectional nature, which was and still is maintained by many scholars, among them Jac-
obi himself (1897: 111). The issue is tied to the syntactic analysis of other compound types, for
instance V1 compounds, which, accordingly, would have at a more recent stage of PIE: see Andri-
otis (1938: 92–93), Lehmann (1969: 1–4), Kastovski (2009: 329). On the implications of the wider

IE languages.60 The high proportion of bahuvrihis in the oldest linguistic layers
of Greek and Vedic may be considered evidence in favour of this view. However,
the caveat expressed above apropos of the paucity of determinative compounds
in early Greek is also relevant to this question, since most of the early documen-
tation is heavily biased towards highly formulaic poetic language abounding in
epithets. Even the bureaucratic language of the Linear B tablets is not particularly
useful for assessing the antiquity of bahuvrihis, because most of the compounds
in question are names, a category in which bahuvrihis are highly prevalent: out of
ca. 150 bahuvrihis included in Waanders (2008: 49–63), at least 112 are onomas-
tic.61 If we had extensive prose passages, our perception of the preponderance of
bahuvrihis might well change, but in the present state we should be careful not to
draw firm conclusions from the ancient evidence in its present state.
     Among those scholars who refuse to analyse the relationship between bahu-
vrihis and determinative compounds in chronological terms, K. Brugmann holds
a position of authority. In a 1906 article Brugmann devoted a few influential pages
to the issue of exocentricity, and the view he expounded was that bahuvrihis are,
quite simply, substantives transformed into adjectives: in other terms, they are
determinative compounds used in an exocentric manner.62 At the same time,
Brugmann was careful not to infer from this that determinative compounds as a
group preceded bahuvrihis: in the second edition of the Grundriss he stated that
bahuvrihis and determinative compounds simply went back to the same stage of
PIE.63 This is certainly the most sensible way of looking at the matter. Bahuvrihis
and determinatives need not have arisen at different chronological stages: they
have the same basic structure, but opposing reference points and functions.
The fact that bahuvrihis are numerically more frequent in the oldest written
stages of IE can mostly be ascribed to the nature of the documentation in our
possession.
5.3 Types and productivity of bahuvrihis
The bahuvrihi type remains a familiar pattern throughout the history of AG. Each
of its subtypes can be illustrated with examples drawn from Mycenaean and
Homeric Greek:

[N N]A type
ke-ro-ke-re-we-o, possibly the genitive singular of the PN /khēro-klewēs/ ‘whose
fame is in the hands, famous for his hands’ is a perfect parallel of historical
names such as Πατροκλῆς ‘having fame from the father’. In both Mycenaean and
Homeric Greek, however, bahuvrihis with clearly substantival FCs are rare (but
see the caveats in section 5.4).
[A N]A type
The PN o-ku-na-wo /ōku-nāwos/ ‘having fast ships’ displays the same FC as the
Homeric epithet ὠκύπτερος ‘having fast wings’. As noted, adjectival FCs are more
common than substantival ones.
[P N]A type
a-pi-do-ra /Amphi-dōrā/ ‘who has gifts all around her’ is one of the clearest bahu-
vrihi PNs of Mycenaean. This prepositional type is well-attested in Homer, with
forms such as ὑπό-ρρηνος ‘with a lamb under it’. There is frequently an overlap
with other classes of compounds which have prepositional FCs, and this involves
a shift in meaning (and thus in compound category). For instance, the morphol-
ogy of the SC suggests that περικαλλής was originally a bahuvrihi of κάλλος
‘beauty’ meaning ‘having beauty all around’, but it soon came to be understood
as a prefixed adjective meaning ‘very beautiful’. Similarly, ἀμφίαλος started off as
a bahuvrihi (‘having the sea all around it’) but could be reinterpreted as a prepo-
sitional compound, ‘which is by the sea’, with ἀμφί- governing the SC.64
[Prefix N]A type
Some of the most productive types of bahuvrihi contain the prefixes ἀ- and
δυσ-. The first is already commonly found in Mycenaean, with forms such as
a-ko-to-no /a-ktoinos/ ‘without land’ and a-ka-ra-no /a-krānos/ ‘without head’.
The prefix δυσ- does not seem to be attested in the extant Linear B tablets, but
the Homeric poems contain up to ten different bahuvrihis with this FC, among
64 Risch (1974: 187).

them δυσκέλαδος ‘having a bad noise, ill-sounding’ and δυσκλεής ‘having a bad
reputation, inglorious’.
[Num N]A type
In the Sanskrit tradition, bahuvrihis with a numerical FC receive the name dvigu.
The type is already well-attested in Mycenaean, with to-pe-za = τράπεζα [four
foot] ‘table’, ti-ri-po-de (dat.) = τρίπους ‘tripod’, qe-to-ro-we /kwetr-ōwes/ (neut.
sg.) ‘with four handles’ (qualifying a vase). In alphabetic Greek, compounds
with a numerical FC often indicate weights and measures: διώβολον ‘coin of two
obols’ (< ‘containing two obols’), δίδραχμον ‘coin of two drachms’, ἑκατόμπεδος
‘a hundred feet long’. Among such cases, forms with the bound FC ἡμι- (which
derives from the root of the numeral *sem- ‘one’) are numerous: e.g. ἡμίδραχμον
‘half-drachma’, ἡμιούγκιον ‘half ounce’, etc. Semantically, these forms often
overlap with determinative compounds (section 4.5).
Although there exist several studies of the language of individual authors, we
lack at present an overview of the development of the bahuvrihi class in Greek
and, in particular, of its productivity at later stages of the language.65 The number
of bahuvrihis in MG seems to have decreased: apart from those surviving or
resurrected from AG, some have their origin in dialectal varieties, most notably
Cypriot, Cretan and other southern dialects. The examples from these varieties
quoted by Ralli (2013: 112–113) tend to be expressions denoting individuals by way
of their physical properties, and may demonstrate that MG, like other modern
European languages, mostly exploits the bahuvrihi type for onomastic purposes
(see 5.4 below). A full diachronic study of bahuvrihis throughout the history of
the language remains a desideratum.
5.4 Metaphorical function of the FC
In Greek, primary adjectives like ὠκύς or λευκός ‘white’ are less numerous
than secondary adjectives, which are derived from nominal stems: for instance,
Αἰγύπτ-ιος ‘Egyptian’ (< Αἴγυπτος ‘Egypt’), κροκό-εις ‘saffron-coloured’ (< κρόκος
‘saffron’), χρύσ-εος ‘golden’ (< χρυσός ‘gold’). Since Greek tends to avoid suf-
fixed forms as compound constituents, it is usually impossible to distinguish
between an adjective and the noun from which it derives when these are used
65 Forster (1950) focuses only on bahuvrihis with a prepositional FC.

in compounding: in Αἰγυπτο-γενής ‘of Egyptian race’, κροκό-πεπλος ‘with saf-
fron-coloured robe’ and χρυσό-πτερος ‘with golden wings’ the FCs always con-
tains a bare stem.66 Because of this formal ambiguity, the structural classification
and semantics of these compounds is often a matter of interpretation: we may
understand κροκόπεπλος to mean ‘with a robe coloured with saffron’ (thus taking
the FC to be a noun in instrumental function) or ‘with a saffron-coloured robe’
(thus taking the FC to be the adjective κροκόεις). The impossibility of drawing a
formal distinction between FCs from nouns and those from secondary adjectives
therefore provide grounds for caution in drawing statistical conclusions concern-
ing bahuvrihis with substantival FCs.
      In semantic terms, bahuvrihis display an overwhelming tendency to employ
secondary adjectives (or the nouns from which they derive) in a metaphorical
fashion.67 ῥοδοδάκτυλος literally means ‘with fingers of roses’: its FC does not
materially indicate that Eos’ fingers are roses, but metaphorically conveys the
idea that they have the same quality (colour, softness, freshness...) as roses. Fol-
lowing Schindler (1986), we may say that ῥοδοδάκτυλος compounds express the
notion ‘X (Eos) has B (fingers) like the quality of A (roses)’. Other bahuvrihis, such
as κυνώπης ‘having the eyes of a dog’, fulfil a different function, namely ‘X has B
(eyes) like that of A (dog)’.68 In both cases, the FCs convey an idea that works as
an apposition of the SC by operating on a metaphorical level.
      The Homeric compounds collected in Risch (1974: 183–184) suggest that
bahuvrihis with a clearly attributive relationship between the constituents (e.g.
χρυσάορος ‘with a golden sword’) were more common. Metaphorical FCs, by
contrast, seem to have been more limited in the first samples of recorded Greek
record and to have been confined to epithets and PNs. Of the very few Mycenaean
compounds with a substantival FC, none has a metaphorical function: we may
surmise that the type was either not yet developed or was associated with a kind
of language which the administrative character of the Linear B tablets does not
represent well.
      Adjectival FCs comprise the majority of bahuvrihis attested in the West Euro-
pean languages, while the number of substantival FCs is far more limited. Judging
from the material collected in Last (1925), almost all of these rare substantival FCs
66 This is part of the Greek tendency to avoid suffixed forms as compound members: the bibli-
ography is collected and commented on in Lindner (2012: 74–84); Schindler (1986) and Stefanel-
li (1997: 262–263) discuss this phenomenon in relation to bahuvrihis. See also Tribulato (2013:
35–37).

have a metaphorical function and indicate physical qualities similar to those of a
material (e.g. the bird-names silk-tail and Seidenschwanz), a concrete object (e.g.
pot-belly) or animal (e.g. Swineshead). All these forms are onomastic, being used as
animal names, surnames, nicknames or toponyms: a clear specialization of such
exocentric compounds is therefore in evidence, a fact that ties in well with their
low productivity in modern Germanic languages.69 The onomastic specialization
of metaphorical bahuvrihis is also observable in a few Old Irish PNs, although
the type as a whole is rare: examples include coinchenn [dog head], milbél [honey
mouth], mordraige (genitive of a name meaning [blood mind] > ‘stupid’), órainech
[gold face], tarbainech [bull face].70 As concerns Romance, bahuvrihis with a sub-
stantival FC are rare and often represent crystallized expressions used in ono-
mastics.71 The evidence from these European languages ties in well with the fact
that in Homeric Greek metaphorical bahuvrihis are usually epithets, i.e. forms
which are by nature very close to onomastics. What emerges, then, is a picture of
bahuvrihis as part of that interchange between the poetic lexicon and onomastics
which is also observable in relation to other AG compound categories, such as V1
compounds (see section 8).
6 V2 compounds
Compounds containing a SC derived from a verbal root, a verbal stem, a verbal
noun or a participle are the most common class in Greek compounding. The
means of creating such V2 compounds is an inherited feature of the language,
but the development of this class in Greek reaches a level of sophistication which
can only be compared to that of Sanskrit. In this respect, Greek is both similar to
and different from English. Like English, Greek develops right-oriented V2 com-
pounds extensively, but while in English the V2 class is morphologically limited
to the common types of synthetics in -er and -ing (which encompass several
semantic classes), in Greek the number of individual subtypes—each attaining a
substantial level of productivity—is much higher and involves all kinds of verbal
nouns and adjectives, as well as participles.72
69 See further Carr (1939: 167–168), Marchand (1969: 387).
70 Uhlich (1993: 115). The type with an adjectival FC, on the other hand, is frequent: see Uhlich
(1993: 116–117). It has a rival in the Armstrong type, on which see section 7.2.2.
71 See the Italian surnames Bellabarba ‘(Mr) nice beard’ and Capogrosso ‘(Mr) big head’.
72 The status of English forms compounded with gerunds, participles and other verbal
nominalizations is disputed and involves the debate over synthetic compounds (see Chapter 1,
section 6.1): for an overview, with references, see Spencer (1991: 324).

86          Chapter Two – The Compound Categories of Ancient Greek
     The next sections provide an introductory and necessarily cursory descrip-
tion of the subtypes of V2 compounds, and from this we will be able to move on
to a consideration of several questions concerning their structure and produc-
tivity. This background knowledge will be useful for the study of the other type
of verbal compounds developed by AG, those with a verbal FC. For the sake of
convenience, the right-oriented subtypes are grouped according to whether their
verbal constituent tends to be a bound form or not. This subdivision is to some
extent a simplistic one, in that there exist individual compounds of the first group
(with bound SCs) which have attested simplicia, while in the second group there
are well-known exceptions such as the large classes of compounds in -ουργός
and -ποιός, which do not correspond to simplicia. However, the subdivision is a
useful means of highlighting the fact that in Greek the overwhelming tendency is
to develop and increase types which correspond to verbal simplicia. Greek thus
moves away from the kind of stem compounding which is reconstructed for PIE
and develops a large class of endocentric compounds in which the head corre-
sponds to a nominal or verbal simplex, while at the same marginalizing the inher-
ited bound types.
6.1 Bound SCs: root compounds
Bound forms are linguistic elements which only occur as part of other words. In
compounding, this is often the case with verbal stems which, modified by suf-
fixes or linking elements, appear as compound constituents (both in second and
first position) but which are not attested in the language as independent words.
In right-oriented root compounds, the SC is a verbal noun formed without overt
suffixes. The typical example of this type is the noun βουπλήξ [ox strike] ‘ox-
goad’: its SC -πλήξ (< πληγ-: -ς marks the nom. sg.) contains the root which in
Greek creates the present πλήσσω ‘to hit’. As with the majority of such verbal
root nouns, -πλήξ is never attested as a simplex. The lack of a derivational suffix
marks the antiquity of this compound type, which survives in the IE languages of
ancient attestation (among them Sanskrit and Latin, with forms such as havir-ád-
‘eating offerings’ and prin-cēps lit. ‘taking the first place’) but overall tends to be
lost or refashioned into more productive types; an exception is Sanskrit, where
the type is extremely productive.73
     The rarity of root compounds in Greek must be due to the fact that they have
three disadvantages. The first is that their SC is almost never attested as an inde-
pendent noun: half of the existing simplicia are found in ancient grammatical
73 See the monograph by Scarlata (1999).

works only and seem to represent learned back-formations that probably never
existed in the spoken language.74 The second disadvantage is their inflection.
The verbal roots employed in these compounds end in a variety of consonants
and vowels and the compounds follow the third declension: the lack of a single
suffix possessed by all of them makes root compounds difficult to pigeonhole as
a well-defined inflectional type. On a semantic level, the lack of a suffix endowed
with a clear-cut function constitutes another disadvantage: root compounds do
not have fixed semantics, but range from an active-transitive meaning (βουπλήξ)
to active-intransitive and even passive semantics (παραβλώψ ‘looking askance’,
δίζυξ ‘double-yoked’), a flexibility which can be manifested even by one and the
same word (e.g. ἀγνώς meaning both ‘not knowing’ and ‘not known’). In terms
of grammatical category too these compounds are ambiguous, insofar as they are
often used as adjectives, but again the difference between an adjectival or sub-
stantival usage is not marked by any suffix: for example, the adjective κορυθάϊξ
‘shaking the helmet’ in Il. 22.132 (κορυθάϊκι πολεμιστῇ ‘warrior shaking the
helmet’) is not characterized by an adjectival suffix.
     These difficulties may account for the fact that already in Archaic Greek
a low number of root compounds are attested: Risch (1974: 196) counts thirty-
one different compounds in the Homeric poems, which, in proportional terms,
amount to a far smaller number than the nine hundred individual forms counted
by Scarlata (1999) for Vedic. These Homeric compounds, moreover, derive from
a limited number of roots which does not increase over time: for the most part,
they are relics, sometimes fossilized as instrument nouns (e.g. χέρνιψ, which
has a precedent in Mycenaean ke-ni-qa ‘hand-washer’), sometimes confined to
poetic language.75
     This lack of a suffix does not apply to roots ending in a vowel. Here, probably
to aid the transition from the vocalic root to the third-declension endings, the
affix -t- is added after the final vowel of the root, e.g. ἀβλής, -τος ‘not thrown’
from the stem βλη- of βάλλω, or ἀγνώς, -τος from the stem γνω- of γιγνώσκω. This
-t- affix, which must reach as far back as PIE since it is also attested in Sanskrit,
Avestan and Latin (sacer-dōs < *sacer-dō-t-s), does not convey any morpho-
semantic function. Such -t-enlarged root compounds were probably the starting
point for one of the most important innovations in Greek word formation, the
development of the category of agentive compounds and nouns in -tās (section
6.4.1). Apart from compounds in -βλής, which exhibit some productivity, these
74 For the residual nature of many Greek root nouns, see Chantraine (1933: 1–5).
75 The ending -a in ke-ni-qa may be interpreted as an accusative singular of the third declen-
sion, but also as the nominative plural of the neuter /khernigwon/, which would imply an early
thematization of the root compound: see Panagl (1977).

-t-enlarged root compounds are residual in Classical Greek and are refashioned,
where possible, into new compounds in -tās or replaced with other agentive
types, all of which have the advantage of a more transparent [N N] structure. As
for the hypothesis that -t-enlarged root compounds are also behind the FCs of V1
compounds, see Chapter 3, section 6, and Chapter 4, section 4.3.1.
6.2 Bound SCs: compounds in -ής
Another type of bound compound deriving directly from verbal roots is that of V2
adjectives in -ής such as γυναιμανής ‘mad for women’, which shares the ē-suffix
with the stative (later passive) aorist ἐμάνην ‘to be mad’.76 The origin of these
verbal compounds is not transparent, but a plausible hypothesis is that two origi-
nally distinct types merged together to create a highly productive class of V2 com-
pounds. The first of these original types was based on -η- aorists; the second came
about when ‘Caland’ bahuvrihis derived from s-stem nouns (e.g. διογενής ‘having
his origin in Zeus’ < γένος ‘kin’) were reinterpreted as V2 compounds (‘born from
Zeus’).77 Such a reinterpretation made it possible to derive compounds from virtu-
ally any verbal stem, regardless of the existence of an -η- aorist.
     V2 compounds in -ής have SCs which are almost always bound forms: the few
simplicia in -ής are clearly back-formations.78 These compounds cover a well-de-
fined semantic spectrum, which ranges from the expression of intransitivity and
passivity to the less common expression of transitivity: one possibility is that they
were initially created to provide Greek with a class characterized by clear intran-
sitive semantics, but which could also express the range of nuances encompass-
ing passive and intransitive, thus differing both from adjectives in -τος (which
are mostly passive) and from other types of V2 compounds (which are mostly
active-transitive).79 Since, however, a few V2 compounds in -ής are also used with
active semantics and might therefore seem to be in competition with other agen-
tive types (most notably V1 compounds), a detailed study of their productivity
vis-à-vis other verbal classes is provided in Chapter 6, section 4.
76 The type is already found in Mycenaean: see po-ro-e-ke (probably with the SC -εχής), ke-re-si-jo
we-ke (probably an analytical spelling for the compound Κρησιοεργής ‘of Cretan craftsmanship’).

6.3 Unbound SCs: agentive adjectives and nouns in -ος
These are compounds with an active or passive meaning whose SC derives from a
verbal root and displays the suffix -ος: the paradigmatic examples for the active
type are κουροτρόφος ‘children-rearing’ (an adjective used as an epithet of lands
and cities) and στράταρχος ‘army-leader’ (a noun), whereas the passive type is
exemplified by ὀρεσίτροφος ‘reared on mountains’, already mentioned in section
5.2. An investigation of the huge productivity of -ος compounds, a type which is
still active in MG, and of the evolving semantics of many individual forms, is well
beyond the scope of the present volume and indeed would require a monograph
of its own. The next sections focus instead on some areas which are relevant for
the investigation of the development of V1 compounds within the Greek com-
pound system: the origin of -ος compounds (section 6.3.1); their development into
an endocentric [N N] structure and interaction with agentive compounds in -της
(section 6.3.2); and their morphological characteristics, particularly as concerns
the shape of the verbal roots from which they derive (section 6.3.3). Our investi-
gation of these issues will provide the necessary background for the full inves-
tigation of Greek V1 compounds undertaken in this book, since -ος compounds
are the most significant rival to V1 compounds, in terms both of semantics (both
classes are agentive) and of usage (both classes create compounds which can be
used as adjectives).
6.3.1 Hypotheses on the PIE origin of -ος compounds
Nouns in -ος are very common in Greek. Simple and compounded agent nouns
make up a very large proportion of them, and can be subdivided into two classes:
1. Nouns in the o-grade from ablauting verbal roots, e.g. τροφός ‘nurturer,
      nurse’ < τρέφω ‘to nourish’.80
2. Nouns from verbal roots which display no ablaut in Greek, e.g. ἀρχός ‘com-
      mander’ < ἄρχω ‘command’.81
In parallel to these agent nouns in -ός, the same verbal roots often produce simple
and compounded nomina actionis (expressing a verbal action) or nomina rei actae
(expressing the result of a verbal action) in -ος such as φόνος ‘murder’. In AG,
these are distinguished from the corresponding agentive nouns by the position of
the accent, as can be seen in the opposition between the agent noun φονός ‘mur-
derer’ and the nomen actionis φόνος ‘murder’. Another kind of formal differenti-

ation between agent and action nouns is achieved through the feminine suffix -ā
(> Attic-Ionic -η) , as in the opposition between the agent noun ἀοιδός ‘singer’ and
the nomen rei actae ἀοιδή ‘song’, or between the agent noun ἀρχός and the nomen
actionis ἀρχή ‘power, ruling’.82
     This system is sufficiently clear for descriptive purposes, although the rela-
tionship between agent and action nouns is often confused, and the same applies
to the relationship between simplicia and compounds.83 The SC of -ος compounds
is often attested independently as a simplex, but this is by no means always the
case.
     When we move to the diachronic level, a number of additional problems
arise. The existence of agentive simplicia in -os cannot be proven beyond doubt,
even though a tripartite system based on the opposition between agent nouns,
action nouns and nomina rei actae can be reconstructed for many IE languages.84
Simplicia agent nouns in -os in particular appear most frequently in Greek, San-
skrit, Baltic and Slavic, but are rare in West IE.85
     A second problem concerns the relation between agentive simplicia in -os
and their compounded forms in the languages of most ancient attestation. In
both Greek and Sanskrit, compound forms of this type are extremely numer-
ous. However, in both languages the compound does not always correspond to a
simplex, and this is particularly noticeable in Sanskrit. Both languages contain a
substantial number of compounds that simply correspond to an action noun or a
nomen rei actae (e.g. Skt. ap-savá- ‘giving water’ vs. savá- ‘libation’ or τειχοδόμος
‘building walls’ vs. δόμος ‘house’).86 Discussions of these problems commonly
assume that the original situation involved a system in which nouns accented
on the root (Greek type φόνος) existed as simplicia, whereas the agent nouns
accented on the last syllable (Greek type φονός) were originally used only in com-
pounding.87 Agentive simplicia were therefore derived from the compounds as
back-formations.88
     Accordingly, as already noted in section 5.1 a common theory for the origin
of the AG agentive compounds in -oς sees them as deriving from old bahuvrihis

containing action nouns in the SC, later re-analysed as agentive compounds.89
For example, the bahuvrihi ἀγάρροος ‘having a strong stream’, whose SC derives
from the nomen rei actae ῥοή ‘stream’, could be interpreted as having the verbal
meaning ‘strong-flowing’: as a consequence, the SC -(ρ)ροος would be classed as
an agent noun (‘someone/something that flows’).90 Similarly, as noted in section
5.1, the passive subtype exemplified by ὀρεσίτροφος may be interpreted as deriv-
ing from possessive compounds with an action noun (τροφή ‘nourishment’),
both on semantic grounds (‘having his nourishment on mountains’) and on
the basis of the accentuation. According to this scenario, the original bahuvrihi
accentuation, which seems to survive in a few active forms including στράταρχος
itself, was later lost in favour of a new pattern which placed the accent on the SC.
Further proof for the bahuvrihi origin of -ος compounds may be the fact that they
are often adjectives with two endings, a pattern which is typical of bahuvrihis.
      The next step in this series of analogical developments would have been the
creation of agentive simplicia from the compounds. The newly created agent nouns
in -ós were distinguished by the appearance of the accent on the last syllable,
and this may have had the purpose of separating them from the barytone action
nouns. In turn, the accent of the simplicia would have influenced that of the com-
pounds. In Sanskrit these compounds are usually accented on the last syllable,
but in Greek this accentual pattern is perturbed by the intervention of ‘Wheeler’s
Law’, according to which in oxytone dactylic words (e.g. **βουληφορός, cf. φορός
‘bearing’) the accent moves from the last to the penultimate syllable (hence the
accentuation βουληφόρος).91 On the basis of analogy, this shift would also have
extended to compounds that do not have a dactylic structure and whose accent
might even go back as far as the antepenultimate syllable, such as κουροτρόφος,
though—as noted—compounds with accented FC are also attested. It is fair to
remark, however, that this reconstructed scenario is highly hypothetical. The fact
that agentive simplicia were created independently in various IE languages might
be cited as evidence for the hypothesis that these were a very old type of nomina
agentis and not back-formations from the compounds.
6.3.2 Compounds in -ος and their simplicia: towards a [N N] structure?
The stage of development evidenced by AG seems to have moved a considerable
distance from the reconstructed original stage. Now many agentive compounds
in -ος correspond to simplicia and this, crucially, allows them to be interpreted

as [N N] compounds rather than [[N [VStem]os]N compounds.92 The fact that these
compounds can be used as adjectives is only an apparent complication, and it is
sufficient to note both that verbal -ος compounds are especially productive for
the creation of titles referring to individuals, so that their interpretation as nouns
is beyond doubt, and that their adjectival use arises in specific contexts: poetic
language in particular favours the use of epithets and appositions. In Myce-
naean, agentive compounds in -ος are usually substantives, and this is probably
attributable to the fact that they are used to name individuals or professions (e.g.
to-ko-so-wo-ko /tokso-worgos/ ‘bow-maker’).
      Most types have both adjectival and substantival usages, and these often
alternate for the same form. Overall, the choice does not seem to be influenced
by the presence or absence of a simplex: for instance, compounds in -ποιός and
-ουργός, for which a simplex is not attested, are mostly substantival. It is possible
that the evolution of verbal -ος compounds towards a transparent [N N] struc-
ture was enhanced by their semantic similarities to agentive compounds in -της;
these, unlike -ος compounds, are exclusively substantives and their [N N] struc-
ture is more self-evident.
      The type of agent compounds in -ος persists in standard MG, and in fact many
of the SCs already attested in AG are preserved. Far from being learned resuscita-
tions of AG words, these compounds are created and used productively, although
it is also true that their productivity is lower than in AG.93 From a synchronic
point of view, many of these MG compounds appear to contain bound SCs, since
they are not attested as independent words, and considerable attention has been
devoted to identifying the nature of these SCs.94 Defining them as stems, Ralli
(2013) classes the compounds as full members of the [N N] category.95 Her conclu-
sion, like mine, is that -ος compounds are right-headed endocentric formations.96
6.3.3 On ablaut in the SC
The bulk of -ος compounds and simplicia derives from ablauting CeC/CoC radical
presents (τρέφω : κουροτρόφος). Some of these verbs may have been refashioned
along different patterns in Greek: see for instance κλέπτω ‘to steal’ < *klep-je/o-,
which replaces an old radical present (cf. Lat. clepō) but preserves the original
ablaut distribution in the perfect κέκλοφα, in the agent noun κλοπός and in the

passive aorist ἐκλάπην. The second substantial, though less numerous, group of
-ος formations derives from Greek (C)v̆C presents which keep this short vowel in
the agent nouns: e.g. ἄρχω : ἀρχός : στράταρχος. This same type of agent noun also
derives from roots which in Greek build zero-grade presents formed with infixes
or suffixes: consider δάμνημι (< *demh2-), the zero-grade of which is continued in
the agent compounds of the ἱππόδαμος type. In cases such as ἱππόδαμος, there-
fore, the short vowel of the agent nouns arises through synchronic morphological
patterns, which tend to replicate the vocalism of the present in deverbal forma-
tions. This tendency may also produce the opposite situation, namely agent nouns
characterized by a long vowel. A case in point is the group of V2 compounds in
-πηγός/-πᾱγός ‘fixing, putting together’, whose long vowel derives directly from
the present πήγνυμι ‘to fix’, a -νυ-infix formation in the e-grade (< *peh2g̑-).
     With the help of these patterns Greek is able to forge an extremely flexible
class of verbal nouns and compounds which can be used to express the full
semantic range of the verbs, as can be observed in those derived from τρέφω
‘to nurture’. κουροτρόφος ‘rearing children’ expresses active-transitive seman-
tics, πρωτότροφος ‘first reared’ has a passive meaning, whereas a large number
of other compounds—in which the FC is either prepositional or does not clearly
express the agent of the passive action—oscillate between passive and active-in-
transitive semantics: ὀρεσίτροφος may mean ‘reared on mountains’ or ‘who
dwells on mountains’, while σύντροφος may mean ‘reared with’ but also ‘living
with’. In the course of this volume, we will particularly focus on active -ος com-
pounds, since they represent the main rival to V1 compounds (which invariably
express active semantics). For the semantic roles expressed by -ος compounds,
see section 6.9.
6.4 Unbound SCs: agentive compounds in -της (and those in -τηρ and -τωρ)
The other common class of agentive compounds displays SCs characterized by the
suffix -της in the Attic-Ionic variety and -τᾱς in all the other dialects: an example
is κυνηγέτης ‘huntsman’ (lit. ‘dog-leader’). Many of these compounds correspond
to simplicia, for instance ἡγέτης ‘leader’. Both simplicia and compounds are a
Greek innovation of vast proportions whose origin is still disputed. The addition
of this category enables Greek to create agentive compounds and nouns out of vir-
tually any root, with the end result being an extremely flexible compound system.
     Simple agent nouns in -της exist alongside those in -τηρ and -τωρ, which
are an inherited category and are usually restricted to simplicia: their extension
to compounds (e.g. πανδαμάτωρ ‘all-taming’ < δάμνημι ‘to tame’ and μηλοβοτήρ
‘shepherd’ < βόσκω ‘to tend’) was probably triggered by analogy with compounds

94          Chapter Two – The Compound Categories of Ancient Greek
in -της.97 The next sections focus on two issues: the hypotheses put forward for
the origin of -της compounds (6.4.1), and the development of these forms within
the Greek compound system in relation to the type of verbs from which they
derive (6.4.2).
6.4.1 The rise of -της forms
We owe to Ernst Fraenkel the first systematic attempt at an explanation of the
rise of the -της suffix.98 In his opinion, -tās is the result of a conflation of the
-t- element, employed in the Sanskrit and Greek root compounds described in
section 6.1, and the -ā vowel, characteristic of root compounds ending in -stā-
(< *steh2- ‘stay’).99 According to this explanation, -tās was generalized to avoid
confusion in the declension of a large number of root compounds. On the basis
of root compounds which displayed the -t- suffix and were provided with the
enlargement -ā-, the sequence -t-ā- was perceived as a suffix and was exported to
other compounds of verbal origin, thus creating a new category.100
     Fraenkel also argued that in response to the same need for clarity, -tās soon
spread from compounds to simplicia.101 The creation of simplicia was also pos-
sible because of the existence of nominal simplicia in -tās like πολίτης. These
could often be interpreted as deriving from both a verb and a noun (e.g. θωρηκτής
‘one armed with a corslet’ vs. θώρηξ ‘corslet’ or θωρήσσω ‘to arm with a corslet’),
so that the suffix also became productive in verbal simplicia for which no com-
pound existed. This account of the events that led to the constitution of a coher-
ent system of forms in -tās is generally accepted.102
     The main challenge to Fraenkel’s theory has come from Leukart (1994). On the
basis of the Mycenaean evidence (which was not available to Fraenkel), Leukart
rejects the idea that -tās is the result of a conflation between root compounds
97 Risch (1974: 29–38). According to Debrunner (1954: 679), the few Sanskrit compounds of this
type belong to ‘laxe Sprache’. Lazzeroni (2010: 258) maintains that -τήρ and -τωρ nouns do not
allow compounding because, in the noun-verb continuum, they are closer to verbs than to nouns.
For the original ablaut distribution of -τήρ with zero-grade roots and -τωρ with full-grade ones,
see Risch (1974: 29–30), Leukart (1994: 47 n. 3); for their original semantic differentiation, see
Benveniste (1948: 45–56) and the caveats in Lazzeroni (1992), with further bibliography. In Greek,
the borders between formations in -τηρ, -τωρ and -της are often confused: for the use of -τηρ and
-τωρ as a means of lending poetry an archaic feel, see Williger (1928: 49).

in -t- and those in -ā-. Leukart’s principal criticism is that verbal nouns in -tās
display semantic and structural characteristics that are very different from those
typical of root compounds: while root compounds are mostly adjectives that can
refer to any person or thing and can acquire either an active or a passive meaning,
nouns in -tās are masculine (active) agent nouns.103 In his search for a more plau-
sible model, Leukart identifies simplicia in -ās of the type /Krētā-s/ ‘the one from
Crete’ (< Κρήτᾱς, Myc. PN ke-re-ta-o, gen.) and /Oreh-ās/ ‘the one from the moun-
tains’ (Myc. PN o-re-a2) as the starting point for -tās nouns.104 Originally, these
simplicia in -ās were ‘social nouns’ (Sozialbezeichnungen) identifying masculine
individuals from the point of view of their geographic or social provenance. The
bestowal of this ‘individualizing’ function on the element -ās was, according to
Leukart, one of the reasons for the success of the -tās suffix and its specialization
for the indication of male individuals.
     As for the origin of -tās itself, Leukart revamps Fraenkel’s hypothesis of the
influence of -stā- compounds and identifies a single Mycenaean root compound
as the source: the PN /Ores-stās/ ‘one who stands on mountains’ (< *steh2-).
According to Leukart, the name was re-segmented as /Ores-tās/ and -tās was per-
ceived as a suffix.105 Through the influence of the above-mentioned ‘social nouns’
ending in -ās, /Ores-tās/ came to be interpreted as ‘the one who has something
to do with the mountains’ and -tās as a suffix indicating pertinence. From there,
according to Leukart, -tās spread to denominative simplicia such as ἀγρό-της
‘countryman’ and then to deverbative nouns such as ἐρέτης ‘rower’, replacing
the old suffix -τήρ. Finally, through the deverbative simplicia, -tās was extended
to compounds and replaced the old root type.106 The replacement also had a
semantic significance: while root compounds are mostly adjectival and express a
neutral verbal idea, compounds in -tās are substantival, refer to specific individ-
uals, and express active semantics.107
     Leukart’s hypothesis may be too bold in positing that a large innovation of this
kind had its starting point in a single word, the PN /Orestās/. Leaving this aside, its
most momentous consequence is the postulation of a system in which simplicia in
-tās exist alongside the compounds and do not derive from them as back-forma-
tions. Compounds in -tās would therefore from the very beginning constitute [N
N] formations. The data from the eight-second centuries BC show that compounds
and simplicia in -της represent a highly regular system based on the correspond-

ence of the simplex to the compound (as in English driver vs. taxi-driver).108 In a
number of cases the -της compound replaces other types of agentive compounds:
examples are κυνηγέτης ‘hunter’ for **κυνηγός or νεφεληγερέτης ‘cloud-gath-
erer’ (also attested in the poetic nom. sg. νεφεληγερέτα) for **νεφεληγορός.109
Among the simplicia, too, numerous new forms are created beside those in -τήρ
and -τωρ and the three types coexist for many verbs throughout Classical Greek:
specific examples will be discussed apropos of those verbs which also give rise to
V1 compounds (Chapter 5, section 5.1, and Chapter 6, section 2.1).
6.4.2 Morphology and structure of -της compounds
In formal terms, -της is a very convenient suffix: its initial [t] makes it phono-
logically stable and compoundable with both vocalic and consonantal stems,
while its ā-declension guarantees flectional regularity. This flexibility does not
seem to be entirely reflected in the distribution of -της in early Greek simplicia,
since -της tends to mark agent nouns from secondary verbs while the old -τήρ and
-τωρ agentive suffixes have a wider range of applications and are characteristic
of primary verbs.110 In the compounds, ablauting verbs may form agent nouns on
both the full and the zero grade, and it is not uncommon to find both for the same
verb: e.g. from βαίνω -βήτης and -βάτης (the latter becoming more common in
later Greek), from δίδωμι -δωτης and -δοτης, from βόσκω -βωτης and -βοτης (the
latter is more common in later Greek).111
     A number of compounds and simplicia display an enlarged version of the
suffix, -ετης.112 The starting point for such forms seems to be compounds from
roots in *-h1 (where -ε- is therefore etymological) which were erroneously seg-
108 The data are analysed in Tribulato (2005: 200–205). They suggest that, overall, Greek
sought to complete pairs of compound and agent noun in -της by providing the existing form
(compound or simplex) with its counterpart. This seems to have happened more frequently with
compounds lacking a simplex and may reveal a tendency to interpret compounds in -της as con-
taining an independent noun in the SC.
109 -ος compounds from ἀγείρω are attested in Mycenaean, with the form ri-na-ko-ro ‘lin-
en-gatherer’; in later Greek they might have been replaced by forms in -ηγερέτης to avoid con-
fusion with the homophonous compounds in -ηγορος from ἀγορεύω: see Chapter 6, section 3.2.
110 Fraenkel (1910: 18–19).
111 The few forms with o-grade (-φόντης, -ποίτης), mostly attested in PNs, seem to import the
vocalic grade of the nomina actionis (φόνος, ποινή), probably to ensure semantic transparency,
given that the phonological changes concerning the outcome of labiovelars in first-millennium

mented: thus, e.g. γενέ-της > γεν-έτης. The analogical -ετης is usually attached
to consonantal stems, probably to preserve morpho-phonological transparency
by avoiding assimilation. A good example is the SC -εργέτης, in which -ετης
has the function of preserving the stem ἐργ- and the connection between these
compounds and ἔργον, blocking the assimilation to ἐρκ- which would ensue if
the suffix were simply -της. The need for transparency may have been felt more
strongly in this case since the connection between the present ἔρδω ‘do’ and
ἐργ- was no longer formally clear. Analogous forms include -βρεμέτης (< βρέμω
‘clash’), -ηγερέτης (< ἀγείρω ‘collect’), -ναιέτης (< ναίω ‘dwell’).113
     -της compounds are as a rule accented on the penultimate syllable. In a few
simplicia, this customary accentuation may be replaced by an oxytone accentua-
tion (e.g. δικαστής ‘judge’). The accent of agent nouns in -τήρ probably triggered
this alternative accentuation, particularly since forms in -της often replace those
in -τήρ (compare δικαστήρ and δικαστής).
     In the spectrum of active meanings, -της compounds—just like other dever-
bative compounds—tend to match the semantic range of their base verb. Those
from ἵστημι, for instance, reflect the active-causative usage of the verb (e.g.
ὀβολοστάτης ‘weigher of obols’) besides the more common active-intransi-
tive meaning (e.g. ὀρθοστάτης ‘upright pillar’, lit. ‘standing upright’).114 There
also are compounds from intransitive verbs such as γίγνομαι ‘to be born’, e.g.
αἰθρηγενέτης ‘originating in pure air’.115
     -της remains a productive suffix throughout the history of Greek. In stand-
ard MG, the derivational pattern is similar to that observed in AG: side by side
with agentive compounds corresponding to simplicia such as θερμιδομετρητής
‘calorie-counter’ (< θερμίδα ‘calorie’ + μετρώ ‘count’) vs. μετρητής ‘counter’,
there are compounds such as αφισοκολλητής ‘person who sticks up posters’ (<
αφίσα ‘poster’ + κολλώ ‘stick’) for which there is no simplex (e.g. **κολλητής
‘person who sticks’). The colloquial nature of some of these neologisms, such
as μαχαιροβγάλτης ‘who takes the knife out, criminal armed with a knife’,
μυγοχάφτης ‘fly-swallower, lazy person’, αγιογδύτης ‘shameless thief, one who
strips (even) saints’, confirms that compounds in -της are not mere resurrections
of AG types, but a productive means of word formation.116

114 Fraenkel (1910: 48–51).
115 Fraenkel (1910: 47) gives a passive interpretation to this compound (‘born in pure air’) in
order to support his claim that -της compounds derive from root compounds, and inherit from
them their neutrality of voice. Of course, the passive understanding of -γενέτης is a matter of
translation, not of Greek semantics.

6.5 Summary: agentive compounds in Ancient Greek
Through the combination of the types in -ος and -της Greek acquires extremely
flexible and productive ways of expressing the full semantic range of a verbal
base when it is compounded with nouns, adjectives and prepositions. The two
types display some important differences which are fundamental to how they are
used in context. -της compounds are specialized for the expression of masculine
agents and are almost always substantival.117 As argued by Leukart, their function
is to indicate well-defined individuals, often by denoting their social class, prove-
nance or profession.118 Such semantic specialization partly restricts the otherwise
completely free derivation of -της simplicia and compounds from any verbal root.
     By contrast, -ος compounds are linked to specific types of verbal stems
(o-grade stems from ablauting roots; zero-grade stems from radical or suffixal
presents in short vowel), but can be used as adjectives. This considerably broad-
ens their range of application, since they can modify masculine, feminine and
neuter nouns: for this reason, they are commonly used as epithets and feature
prominently in poetic or elevated language. This function brings -ος compounds
closer to V1 compounds, which are prototypically adjectival. Moreover, because
of their adjectival nature, -ος compounds may also express passive semantics,
thus competing with the semantic domains of -ής and -τός V2 compounds: -ος
compounds with this function are not in direct competition with the domain of V1
formations, since they predominantly express active semantics.
     The substantival use of -ος compounds is not marginal, however: already
in Mycenaean Greek, -ος formations are employed for the denomination of indi-
viduals performing actions and fulfil some of the functions associated with -της
nouns (see the common types in -wo-ko / -ουργός ‘worker’ and -do-mo / -δόμος
‘builder’). Although the adjectival function of -ος compounds never recedes in
Greek, the existence of many -ος simplicia side by side with the compounds seems
to have encouraged their use as nouns and the interpretation of the whole class
as a [N N] type. The fact that the SC of some -ος compounds is never attested as
a simplex does not invalidate this analysis: a German speaker knows that there
is no simplex **Haber corresponding to Liebhaber (which should be analysed as
[[Lieb-hab]er]), but he or she would nevertheless be able to associate the SC of the
compound with a particular class of nouns, following the structure of pairs such
as Zuckerbäcker ‘confectioner’ ([Zucker[Bäcker]) vs. Bäcker ‘baker’. In Greek,
117 The few feminine forms are mostly simplicia formed with the suffixes -τρίς, -τρία and -τειρα,
originally ‘Motionsfeminina’ of -τήρ nouns: see Chantraine (1933: 340–341), Lejeune (1950), Risch
(1974: 135, 142).

existing pairs such as κουροτρόφος vs. τροφός might have provided a model for
the interpretation of ἀγαλματοποιός as containing **ποιός. What matters here is
the possibility of linking the SC of such V2 compounds to a class of nouns.119 This
ties in well with other phenomena observed in the AG compound system, such
as the elimination of root compounds, the creation of -της compounds and the
increase of determinative compounds, all of which suggest an increasing prefer-
ence for [N N] endocentric structures.
6.6 Unbound SCs: compounded participles
Greek is also capable of expressing active or passive verbal semantics by means
of compounded participles such as πασιμέλουσα ‘of interest to all’ (< μέλω ‘be an
object of care’) and ἐυκτίμενος ‘well-built’ (an old root aorist participle, connected
to the more recent verb κτίζω ‘build’). This type is extremely limited, however.
An ample range of substantival FCs is only found in PNs such as Λαομέδων and
Ἱπποδάμας, which usually have transparent semantics (‘who protects/rules over
the people’ and ‘who tames horses’ respectively); the type is already attested in
Mycenaean. Outside onomastics, the few substantival FCs often betray the syntac-
tic origin of the compound through the use of case endings: this is the case with
πασιμέλουσα (which in Od. 12.70 may well cover for the phrase πᾶσι μέλουσα) and
for other early participles, such as δαϊκτάμενος ‘slain in battle’ (< δάϊ κτάμενος).
Similarly, ἐυκτίμενος may derive from the univerbation of εὖ κτίμενος.
     According to Risch (1974: 211), the original core of compounded participles
comprises forms negated through the prefix ἀ- (e.g. ἀκάμας ‘untiring’). The few
new forms produced in Classical Greek are usually epithets and often betray an
onomastic origin: an example is ποντομέδων ‘lord of the sea’ (epithet of Posei-
don), which finds parallels in the PNs Λαομέδων and Εὐρυμέδων. Given these
structural restrictions, it is not surprising that Greek resorts to other formations
to express active and passive verbal semantics.120
119 Uhlich (2002: 406–407), Kastovsky (2009: 326–327).
120 According to Lazzeroni (2010: 263), the reason for the low compoundability of participles
may be that they are ‘more verbal’ than adjectives in -τος and agent nouns in -της. Cf. his similar
conclusions on the exclusion of -τήρ and -τωρ agent nouns from compounding in note 97 above.

6.7 Unbound SCs: V2 adjectives in -τoς
In AG, the most common way of using a nominal to express a passive verbal
action is to form a passive adjective in -τoς such as φιλητός ‘loved, worthy of
love’.121 The suffix -tos originally formed resultative verbal adjectives, which were
neutral as concerns voice but were later acquired by some languages to fulfil the
function of passive participles (the case of Latin amātus ‘loved’) and were kept by
others as verbal adjectives.122
     In Greek, -τoς adjectives compete with passive participles and replace them
in compounding.123 The FC of the compounds can be prefixes, adverbs and prep-
ositions (e.g. ἀφίλητος ‘unloved’) or nouns which mostly perform the role of the
agent or cause (e.g. θεοφίλητος ‘loved by the gods’). This type of compound is
found in other IE languages, for instance in Latin (mani-festus ‘clear’, lit. ‘struck
with the hand’) and Sanskrit (a-jāta- ‘unborn’). However, it is commonly assumed
that in the parent language FCs were limited to the negative prefix and a few
adverbs.124
     Substantival FCs, although seemingly less frequent, appear in these com-
pounds as early as Mycenaean (e.g. ka-ko-de-ta /khalkodeta/, neut. pl., ‘fastened
with bronze’), continue in Homeric Greek, and are also found in Classical inscrip-
tions: examples of the latter include, e.g. δημιόπρᾱτα ‘sold by public author-
ity’, μολυβδόδετος ‘fastened with lead’.125 The compounds are to be considered
endocentric, insofar as they represent a subset of the idea expressed by their SC.
However, the most common types of compounded -τος adjectives remain those
with a prefix or an adverb in the FC.
     As concerns productivity, simplicia and compounds in -τoς began to decline
in Hellenistic Greek, losing ground to the passive perfect participle, particularly
in the lower Koine (though new -τoς compounds are found in literary Byzantine
Greek). This development led to the MG replacement of -τoς formations with
adjectives in -μένος, which on a formal level are a continuation of the perfect
participle.126 The functions of these passive compounds were also transferred to
compounds of the ὀρεσίτροφος type and to V2 adjectives in -ής, which continued
to be productive down to Byzantine Greek.

6.8 Unbound SCs: residual classes
Greek V2 compounds also include a few more limited types which will here be
summarily described in the light of their possible interaction with V1 compounds.
1. Nouns and adjectives in -ᾱς (> -ης in Attic-Ionic) identifying agents and agen-
     tive actions, such as ὑψαγόρης ‘braggart’ and χαμαιεύνης ‘sleeping on the
     ground’. The type seems to have its origin in bahuvrihis with feminine nouns
     in the SC (< ἀγορά ‘public speaking’, εὐνή ‘bed’), but since many of these
     nouns derive from verbs or create -έω denominatives, -ης is later reinter-
     preted as a deverbative suffix tout court.127 This type of compound is well-at-
     tested in Classical Greek, sometimes providing alternatives to agent nouns in
     -ος and -της, and thus also to V1 compounds: see for instance compounds in
     -φίλᾱς/-φίλης such as γυναικοφίλᾱς ‘lover of women’, which compete with
     those in φιλο-. As we will see in Chapter 6, however, the competition between
     V1 compounds and these forms in -ᾱς/-ης is limited.
2. Isolated compounds in which the SC is a verbal noun expressing agentive
     semantics. Risch (1974: 212) conveniently lists Homeric compounds derived
     from verbs through suffixes different from those typically used with an agen-
     tive function. These forms include adjectives such as πολυτλήμων ‘much-en-
     during’, based on the stem τλη- ‘to endure’ and whose suffix -μων is used to
     derive animate nouns, often from verbal roots.128 Though productive, these
     animate nouns in -μων are not very common in compounding and do not rep-
     resent a genuine rival to other agentive formations, including V1 compounds.
3. Compounded action nouns. Apart from the previously mentioned o-grade
     action nouns in -ος (φόνος), Greek also preserves the old PIE type of primary
     action noun in -tis, mostly remade into -σις through assibilation (e.g. δόσις
     ‘giving’), and creates secondary nomina actionis or nomina rei actae in -ία
     (ἁμαρτία ‘failure’ < ἁμαρτάνω ‘to fail’), -ιον (σφάγιον ‘sacrifice’ < σφάζω ‘to
     sacrifice’), and -σία (θυσία ‘sacrifice’ < ‘sacrifice’). These suffixes are highly
     productive, particularly the last three, which allow the derivation of action
     nouns from other types of nouns. All these action nouns are also found in
     compounds, e.g. ἐτνήρυσις ‘soup-ladle’, εὐαγγέλιον ‘good news’, βοηλασία
     ‘cattle-lifting’, αὐλῳδία ‘song to the flute’. Since all these nouns identify
     actions, not agents, their semantic and structural interaction with V1 com-
     pounds is non-existent.
127 Rüedi (1969) studies the development of the verbal meaning of these compounds. For the
hypothesis that they might be connected with the Latin agricola type, see Fraenkel (1912: 169–
174) and Rüedi (1969: 27).

6.9 Greek right-oriented V2 compounds: summary
The main distinction within the vast class of AG right-oriented V2 compounds
is between compounds with a bound SC and compounds in which the SC corre-
sponds to a simplex, or to a productive class of nominals. This latter type is much
more common, proving—if anything—that AG has moved a considerable distance
from the original stage of PIE compounding, which is supposed to have privileged
stem compounding. Both bound and unbound formations have adjectival and
substantival types, but bound compounds tend to be mostly adjectival. The cre-
ation of -της compounds and the huge increase in -ος compounds is clear proof
that Greek gradually evolved into an endocentric compound system, in which the
determined compound element (usually the SC) represents a hyperonym of that
which is denoted by the whole compound.
     For this reason, it is better to avoid the term ‘synthetic’ in connection with
Greek V2 compounds. This term is sometimes used in the classification of IE V2
compounds, probably based on Wackernagel’s authoritative model.129 However,
while in Sanskrit the number of V2 compounds in which the SC is not attested as
a simplex is very high, we saw above that this is not the case in Greek: on the con-
trary, Greek tends to forsake bound types (an exception are V2 adjectives in -ής) or
to develop correspondences between compounds and simplicia. Another reason
that the term ‘synthetic’ is best avoided, moreover, is the controversy surrounding
the interpretation of the morphological and syntactic properties of synthetic com-
pounds in (mostly) English. Not all scholars agree that a V2 compound in which
the non-head does not satisfy the argument function is a synthetic compound
(see Chapter 1, section 6.1).130 Instead, some approaches hold that compounds
such as party drinker ‘a person who drinks at parties’ are not synthetics, since the
non-head expresses determination.131 The same terminological problem would
arise in connection with the many Greek V2 compounds whose non-head does
not function as the argument of the verbal head, e.g. ναύμαχος ‘fighter on ships’,
ὀλιγαρχία ‘power of a minority’, etc. Because of these ambiguities, and since the
present study is not concerned with the theoretical issue of incorporation, the
term ‘synthetic’ has been avoided.
     Following on from this, the last issue worth considering concerns the variety
of syntactic functions displayed by the FCs of Greek V2 compounds. The funda-

mental division is between cases where the non-head is an adjective, preposition
or adverb and those where it is a noun. In the first type of case, the non-head
functions as a modifier: consider the root compounds δίζυξ ‘double-yoked’ and
ἄγνως ‘not knowing’, as well as the agentive compounds ἀκροβάτης ‘who climbs
aloft, acrobat’ and εὐεργέτης ‘who does well, benefactor’. When the non-head is a
noun, however, its function is not pre-determinable and depends on the context,
as well as on the semantic properties of the base verb. We have just seen that in
compounds such as ὀλιγαρχία ‘power of a minority’ the non-head expresses a
modification of the verbal SC -αρχία. In many other cases, the non-head fulfils a
role which is not restricted to the object of the verbal base (as e.g. in κουροτρόφος
‘rearing children’), but may correspond to a range of roles: locative in ναύμαχος
‘fighter on ships’, instrument in χαλκήρης ‘fitted with bronze’, agent in θεομισής
‘heated by the gods’ and διόσδοτος ‘given by Zeus’, etc. A similarly wide range of
roles are also fulfilled by V1 compounds, and such flexibility emerges as another
defining characteristic of Greek compounding.132
7 Left-oriented subordinated compounds
Greek left-oriented categories are of two types: productive categories, which are
cross-linguistically left-oriented; and more limited categories, which often repre-
sent counterparts of common right-oriented categories and whose productivity
may be limited to a few well-defined subtypes. The theoretical question under-
lying the analysis of these categories and their relation to right-oriented ones is
whether syntax, and particularly word order, plays a role in their orientation. In
the literature, the issue has been discussed particularly in relation to V1 com-
pounds and the so-called ‘reversed bahuvrihis’ (section 7.2.1), and it is at the core
of the controversy concerning the nature of compounding itself, namely whether
compounding is influenced by syntax, representing the quintessential interface
between morphology and syntax, or whether its morphological processes are
independent of syntactic structures.
132 Ralli (2013: 189), building on previous work, speculatively argues that ‘languages with
strong morphology (i.e. with overt realization of inflectional features), such as Greek, allow a va-
riety of theta-roles to be saturated inside compounds, whereas languages with weak morphology
(i.e. with no overt realization of inflectional features), such as English, allow for a more limited
set of theta-roles to be saturated’. I have refrained from entering the theoretical debate concern-
ing thematic roles and theta-roles in compounding, which is not relevant to the present analysis
of AG: for an overview, see Lühr (2004).

104         Chapter Two – The Compound Categories of Ancient Greek
     The following sections provide a descriptive morphological introduction to
the categories of prepositional compounds, left-oriented exocentric and endocen-
tric determinative compounds, and V1 compounds. This is followed by a typolog-
ical overview of word order issues and an introduction to Greek word order, with
the aim of highlighting the syntactic nature of a number of Greek left-oriented
categories. The orientation of Greek V1 compounds cannot be simply understood
on the basis of synchronic word order and probably results from the combination
of an inherited syntactic pattern with inner-Greek morphological needs, as Chap-
ters 4–6 of this volume argue in detail.
7.1 Prepositional compounds
The FC of these compounds is a preposition which governs a SC derived from a
noun, as in ἐπιδήμιος ‘among the people’. In the corresponding syntactic phrase
the preposition selects a specific case of the word contained in the SC (here: ἐπὶ
δήμου ‘among the people’): for this reason, the relationship between the com-
pound constituents is truly one of government and indeed is the only relation-
ship unequivocally of this type in Greek compounding. This governing relation-
ship between FC and SC marks the difference between authentic prepositional
compounds and other types of compounds in which the prepositional FC does
not govern the SC, but rather specifies it. ἐπιδήμιος and upstream are different
from ἐπιμάρτυρος ‘(additional) witness’ and uptight, since in these compounds
the prepositions ἐπί and up do not govern the SC, but rather modify the noun
μάρτυρος and the adjective tight. ἐπιμάρτυρος and uptight are therefore endo-
centric determinative compounds while, crucially, ἐπιδήμιος and upstream are
exocentric, since they refer to something which lies outside the compound con-
stituents. In Greek, derivation from prepositional phrases (‘hypostasis’) and exo-
centricity are usually marked by adjectival suffixes, identical to those found in
bahuvrihis: -ος/-ον (e.g. in ἔφαλος ‘on the sea’, where the SC is from ἅλς) and
-ιος/-ιον (as in ἐπιδήμιος).133
     Prepositional compounds of this kind are attested in various other IE lan-
guages, including Latin (egregius ‘outstanding’< ē grege ‘(standing) out of the
flock’), Sanskrit (ádhi-gartya ‘on the driver’s seat’), Armenian (aṛač̣awk‘ ‘ghost’
< ‘in front of the eyes’), Germanic (ør-viti ‘out of (one’s) senses’, still used in Far-
oese).134 Modern English possesses a productive type of formation in which the
FC is a Classical preposition (transatlantic, anti-British, pro-feminist), but trans-,

anti- and pro- are not productive as prepositions in English, being rather pre-
fixes: for this reason, formations of this kind pertain more to derivation than to
compounding.135 The high number of prepositional compounds developed in AG
seems to be unmatched by other languages and remains a largely unexplored
topic in the field of Greek compounding.136
     The Linear B tablets already contain some uncontroversial prepositional
compounds, such as e-pi-ki-to-ni-ja /epi-khitōnia/, a neuter plural indicating
objects fastened ‘on the tunic’, and e-po-mi-jo /ep-ōmiō/, the dual of a compound
indicating shoulder pieces (things which stay ‘on the shoulder’), alongside other
forms of controversial interpretation.137 In Mycenaean, as in later Greek, the
structural and semantic overlap with bahuvrihis of the type ὑπόξυλος ‘having
wood underneath’ and with determinatives such as ἐπιμάρτυρος is high.138 The
erosion of the semantic domain of prepositions in post-Classical Greek and their
gradual disappearance from late-antique Greek onwards meant that the preposi-
tional type became increasingly marginalized, and in MG it is mostly of a learned
nature: this is also a consequence of the fact that many of the ancient prepo-
sitions are no longer available as such, having instead acquired the status of
prefixes.139 Moreover, it is difficult in objective terms to tell new learned creations
apart from learned survivals: phonology sometimes comes to the rescue, as in
the case of αντηλιακό ‘sunscreen’, which does not take into account the initial
aspiration of the AG form ἥλιος ‘sun’ (in AG the FC would have been ἀνθ-) and is
therefore a modern formation.140
     In the IE family, prepositional compounds are the prototypical class of left-ori-
ented compounds. It is commonly assumed that in PIE the adverbs which later
gave rise to prepositions could either precede or follow a case form, although it
is also thought that the postposition of such adverbs was more common, in com-
pliance with the basic SOV order postulated for PIE.141 Thus, preposition-initial
compounds might either reflect the marked position of adverbs (as opposed to
the unmarked SOV word order), or they might reflect the word order that became
135 Kastovsky (2009: 338), however, seems to treat transatlantic and similar forms as productive
compound types which continue an inherited pattern.
136 Mikkola (1962) and Mikkola (1965) do not address the productivity of the type in a diachron-
ic perspective. Mikkola (1962: 114) provides a statistical comparison between Greek and Latin,
which confirms the greater productivity of the type in Greek.

standard after PIE had shifted from a SOV to a SVO structure and adverbs came to
be placed before nouns.142
       Another question is whether this orientation is perhaps less language-spe-
cific and in fact reflects a universal tendency to place governing elements such
as prepositions before their governed noun. Judging from the available evidence,
left-oriented prepositional types are the majority, but right-oriented specimina are
registered in Germanic (e.g. zweifelsohne ‘doubtless’ in German) and in Slave—a
language in the Athapaskan family of indigenous North American languages,
spoken in Northwest Canada—which has [N Postposition]N compounds such as lu
k’ ɛ́ ‘spring’ (< lu ‘ice’ + k’é ‘after’ ‘after-ice’).143
7.2 Left-oriented determinative compounds
The case of prepositional compounds is very different from that of the few endo-
centric and exocentric determinative compounds displaying left-orientation.
While, as noted, prepositional compounds follow a common typological pattern
and have a high productivity in AG, left-oriented determinative compounds are
limited, and mostly represent reversed counterparts of more established right-ori-
ented types. An important exception within the determinative macro-category is
represented by adjective-initial determinative compounds (e.g. ἀξιόλογος ‘worthy
of mention’) which, as is argued in section 7.4, may owe their left-orientation to
specific morpho-syntactic constraints associated with their heads. Another
well-defined group, which may have originated from left-headed syntagms, con-
tains animal and plant names (e.g. σύαγρος [pig wild] ‘wild pig’, καρποβάλσαμον
[fruit balsam] ‘fruit of the balsam tree’), and these are mostly used in technical
prose or lower-level Greek.
7.2.1 The question of ‘reversed bahuvrihis’
Standard treatments of Greek compounding often reserve a few words for forms
such as θυμολέων [heart lion] > ‘lion-heart’, ποδ́νεμος [foot wind] > ‘having swift
feet’, ὀνομ́κλυτος [name famed] ‘having a famous name’, πόδαργος [foot swift]
‘having swift feet’, which, because of their apparently peculiar orientation, are
either dismissed as oddities or explained as a reversed (and usually late) version
142 Lehmann (1974: 212).
143 For these Slave compounds, see Rice (2009: 549). However, Slave also has postposition-initial
compounds, discussed in Rice (2009: 550).

of established bahuvrihis.144 In an analysis of ‘reversed bahuvrihis’ in Welsh
and Germanic, however, Zimmer (1992) goes so far as to claim that this category
goes back to a ‘zumindest gemeinindogermanisches Alter’.145 It is not possible to
consider the whole of Zimmer’s argument here, which focuses on evidence from
languages as diverse as Old Irish, Sanskrit, and Germanic. As far as Greek is con-
cerned, however, his conclusion should certainly be moderated. The Greek candi-
dates for ‘reversed bahuvrihi’ status are not all of the same kind and an in-depth
examination, combining morphological, syntactical and literary analysis, shows
that many of them can instead be explained in accordance with right-oriented
patterns.146
7.2.2 The Armstrong subtype
Let us begin by tackling the [N A]A reversed subtype, which is exemplified by
ὀνομ́κλυτος and πόδαργος. Evidence from languages in which the type is more
common suggests that the starting point for these formations in Greek is not an
authentic inversion of the more established right-oriented [A N]A type, but rather
a process of derivation from phrases containing an accusative of respect and an
adjective: ὄνομα κλυτός ‘famous a concerns the name’, πόδα ἀργός ‘swift as con-
cerns the foot’.147 A comparable type are the Celtic Armstrong compounds, the old
core of which may be identified with adjectival determinative compounds with a
noun as their modifier: ‘strong with respect to the arms’.148 The adjectival SC has
an ambiguous reference: strong may refer to the external entity, but it may also
qualify the FC arm. Because of this ambiguity, the type could be semantically
re-interpreted as having a possessive sense: ‘with strong arms’.
     The paucity of the Greek formations vis-à-vis the productivity of the Arm-
strong type in Celtic and Germanic ties in well with the hypothesis that the com-
pounding of adjectives with substantival modifiers was not a fully developed lin-
guistic process in late PIE and early Greek (section 4.6). ὀνομ́κλυτος, πόδαργος,
κορυθαιόλος ‘colourful at the helmet’, στόμαργος ‘swift/white at the mouth’ and
similar formations thus are not affected by this constraint because they arise from
a process of derivation from syntactic structures rather than from compounding

proper.149 The specific phrases underlying ὀνομ́κλυτος etc. explain why they,
and not others, are the compounds which were created in early Greek. In all
these phrases, the first word, in the accusative singular, ends in a short vowel
(ὄνομα, πόδα, κόρυθα, στόμα); in three out of four, the adjective begins with
the same sound (ἀργός, αἰόλος). It is likely that these phrases were pronounced
with elision/coalescing of the two vowels: e.g. [ˈpoda arˈgos], naturally evolving
into [ˈpodargos]. The univerbation of ὄνομα κλυτός could also occur without any
formal (and metrical) changes, since FCs in -ᾰ are common in Greek (e.g. ἀνδρᾰ-,
μεγᾰ, etc.). A similarly syntactic origin may explain the productivity of other
determinative compounds with adjectival heads (section 7.4).
     As noted in Chapter 1, section 4.4, it is not possible to be sure about the
authentic spelling and pronunciation of these forms, but two comments are nec-
essary. As concerns the univerbation of πόδαργος, this must predate Homeric
Greek and (possibly) also Mycenaean, since in both linguistic layers this form is
used as a PN.150 As concerns accentuation in the compounded forms, there are
two options: either the accent remained on the SC even after the univerbation had
taken place, or it moved backwards on analogy with bahuvrihis; our texts and
dictionaries treat these forms in an oscillating manner.151
     Once univerbations of this kind were semantically re-interpreted as possessive
compounds, the unrestricted creation of left-oriented bahuvrihis became feasible.
Indeed, this is what happened in Old Irish, where individual [A N]A compounds are
sometimes transparent inversions of more established right-oriented bahuvrihis (in
Greek, see e.g. Κλεοπάτρη vs. Πάτροκλος).152 However, Greek does not seem to have
taken full advantage of the type, probably because of the pressure from right-ori-
ented bahuvrihis and the whole right-oriented compound system.
7.2.3 [N N]A reversed bahuvrihis?
Having ruled out the hypothesis that some Greek [N A]A compounds are reversed
bahuvrihis, we can now consider [N N]A candidates for this status. Unlike its
right-oriented counterpart, this subtype is relatively rare in Greek and limited
almost exclusively to onomastics or epithets: this analysis will therefore focus
on those Homeric epithets such as θυμολέων ‘lion-heart’, ποδ́νεμος ‘having

wind in the feet, very fast’ and Εἰδοθέη ‘having the appearance of a goddess, very
beautiful’ which are typically included in discussions of Greek reversed bahuvri-
his.153 Those who have tackled these compounds have tended to remark on their
reversed status and to link their origin to the existence of synonymic forms, such
as ἀελλόπος ‘with feet like storm, very fast’ for ποδ́νεμος and θεοειδής ‘god-like’
for Εἰδοθέη.154 If interpreted as bahuvrihis, all these compounds would follow the
semantic patterns identified by Schindler (1986): θυμολέων and Εἰδοθέη would
mean ‘having A (heart, aspect) like that of B (lion, goddess)’, while ποδ́νεμος
would mean ‘having A (feet) like B (wind)’.
     The inversion of an existing compound is of course a likely possibility in the
poetic language of epic. However, all these early instances of ‘reversed bahuvr-
ihis’ are also explicable with reference to regular patterns: they could either be
right-oriented bahuvrihis in which the FC functions as a metaphorical locative
(‘having a lion in his heart’, ‘having a god in her appearance, ‘having wind in
his feet’);155 or, more plausibly, compounds deriving from predicative phrases,
in which the FCs corresponds to an accusative of respect ‘(like) a lion with refer-
ence to his heart’, ‘(like) a goddess with reference to her aspect’, ‘(like) wind with
respect to his feet’. This pattern is attested, for instance, in the Pindaric phrase
τόλμᾳ γὰρ εἰκώς | θυμὸν ἐριβρεμετᾶν θηρῶν λεόντων | ἐν πόνῳ, μῆτιν δ’ ἀλώπηξ
‘for he resembles the boldness of loudly roaring wild lions in his heart during
the struggle, but in skill he is a fox...’ (Pi. I. 3/4.45–47, trsl. W. H. Race). Phrases in
which the accusatives θυμόν, πόδα/πόδας and εἶδος limit a noun or an adjective
are common in Homer; in the Homeric poems, moreover, these nouns are also
found in similes containing the words λέων, θεός and ἄνεμος.156
     θυμολέων, Εἰδοθέη and ποδ́νεμος would then display a similar structure to
that of Armstrong compounds, with the difference being that their SC is a noun and
not an adjective. In the same way that ὀνομ́κλυτος and πόδαργος are endocentric,
because they represent subtypes of κλυτός and ἀργός, θυμολέων could be inter-
preted as an endocentric determinative used as an apposition. This pattern might
have originated in onomastics, where determinative compounds are used: just as
Θεόδωρος is ‘god’s gift’, θυμολέων is ‘lion at heart’.157 In conclusion, as in the case
of [A N]A compounds, it is advisable to abandon the idea that Greek exploited a
‘reversed bahuvrihi’ pattern, even though there exist instances, especially among
PNs, for which such an interpretation would be the most straightforward one.

7.3 Left-oriented endocentric determinative compounds with a substantival
7.3 head
Left-oriented [N N]N or [N A]N endocentric determinative compounds are not
numerous in Greek and can usually be explained as the reversed counterpart of
right-oriented types, which are typical of poetic language or technical registers.
In some cases, the interference from syntactic structures is at the origin of these
types and we will briefly examine some of these issues.
     Various forms are quoted in the literature as possible cases of poetic left-ori-
ented endocentric determinative compounds, but in many of these cases an
alternative right-oriented explanation is preferable. For instance, the epithet
πλουτόχθων ‘rich in treasures of the earth’ (LSJ), which is applied to γόνος
‘offspring’ in a choral ode of Aeschylus’ Eumenides (947) can be interpreted as
a right-oriented bahuvrihi meaning ‘having a land of riches’ rather than as a
left-oriented substantival apposition meaning ‘richness of the land’.158
     An interesting left-oriented compound, again found in Aeschylus, is Dio-
nysus’ epithet θέοινος ‘god of wine’ (fr. 382 Radt, later re-used by Lyc. Al. 1247).
The epithet seems to have been known outside poetry, since it gave its name to
an Attic feast in honour of the god.159 The compound may therefore have been a
common word of the popular Attic lexicon, perhaps result of a univerbation. In
this respect, the epithet would be similar to other god-names, such as Δημήτηρ
and Ποσειδῶν, which derive from the univerbation of phrases (meaning ‘Mother
Earth’ and ‘Spouse of the Earth’ respectively). θέοινος perhaps derives from invo-
cations of the god in which the vocative (θεός) was followed by the determining
genitive οἴνου: this would involve haplology of the final syllable of θεός.
     Another set of left-oriented determinative involves names of animals and
plants; the latter mostly occur in scientific prose.160 Among animal names, a
coherent group is represented by -αγρος compounds, all indicating a type of wild
beast. The first attested of these compounds is σύαγρος ‘wild pig, boar’ (Dion.
Trag. and Antiphanes Com.), followed by the much later ὄναγρος ‘wild ass’
(LXX), αἴγαγρος ‘wild goat’ (Gal.), βόαγρος ‘wild bull’ (Philostr.) and ἵππαγρος
‘wild horse’ (Opp.). All of these compounds correspond to attested phrases of the
type αἶγες [...] ἄγριαι (Hom. Od. 9.118–119), βόες ἄγριοι (Hdt. 7.126.2), ὄνοι ἄγριοι
158 In πλουτόχθων, an epithet referring to the silver mines of Laurion, the use of the nominal FC
πλουτο- in place of the derived adjective πλούσιος is likely to have been inspired by the wish to
allude to Pluto (Πλούτων), the god who presides over mines.

(Hdt. 7.86.2) and ἵπποι ἄγριοι (Hdt. 4.52.1). The deletion of the adjectival marker in
ἄγριος > -αγρος is necessary for the compound to be considered a noun and not
an adjective. The shape of the SC may also be influenced by some compounds
in which -αγρος derives from ἀγρεύω ‘to hunt’, although there is no reason to
suppose that ἀγρεύω provided all the SCs of these compounds, as claimed by
Wackernagel.161 The early appearance of the corresponding phrases just quoted
provides strong evidence that the expressions were widespread and the creation
of compounds out of these expressions must have happened already in early Clas-
sical Greek. The fact that ὄναγρος features in one of the Psalms only confirms that
these compounds belonged to everyday Greek and not, as Wackernagel assumed,
to fashionable language.162
      That -αγρος compounds derive from phrases containing ἄγριος is also sug-
gested by the structure of another left-oriented animal name, ἱπποπόταμος. This
compound, which first appears in the first/second century AD, has a clear ante-
cedent in the phrase ἵππος ποτάμιος (Hdt., Thphr.). The transformation of this
phrase into a compound with the SC ποτάμιος may be formally influenced by
bahuvrihis ending in -πόταμος, such as διπόταμος ‘having two rivers’ (Eur.).
      Various plant names, occurring in scientific prose, may similarly have been
influenced by the occurrence of phrases in which a noun is specified by an adjec-
tive or genitive. A number of these plant names feature the FC ὀπο- from ὀπός
‘plant juice’. The first of these forms, ὀποβάλσαμον ‘juice of the balsam tree’,
is attested in Theophrastus.163 Later forms include ὀποπάναξ ‘juice of Hercu-
les’ woundwort’ and ὀποκάλπασον ‘juice of flax’ (a kind of myrrh), both used
by Galen. All these forms meet with huge success in late-antique and Medieval
Greek, where they become the standard way to refer to these particular plants
or extracts. In earlier Greek, phrases containing ὀπός followed by the genitive of
a plant name can occur side by side with the corresponding compound, some-
161 Wackernagel (1895: 47) interprets βοάγριον ‘shield’ as ‘shield made from the leather of a
hunted bull’, the name of the Locrian river βοάγριος as ‘river where the hunted bulls seek shelter’
and the name Σύαγρος as ‘boar-hunter’. He suggests that the connection between the SCs and
ἄγριος did not exist before the fourth century, when Antiphanes and Dionysius I used σύαγρος
with the meaning of ‘wild pig’ for the first time. Risch (1949: 286) agrees with this interpretation.
An early derivation from ἄγριος however is equally possible and Σύαγρος may well be under-
stood as one of those Greek names which compare their bearer to the qualities of the named
beast: the aristocratic associations of σῦς are well-known.
162 σύαγρος is the topic of a learned conversation in Ath. 9.64, in which the meaning ‘pig-hunt-
er’ attributed to the PN is contrasted with the meaning ‘wild boar’ which is given as the current
one in Athenaeus’ time and which Democritus (one of the banqueters) backs up with a quotation
from the Attic playwright Antiphanes, who puts it in the mouth of a boaster.

times even in the same passage, as in Gal. Comp. med. per gen. 13. 628.18–19: τοῦ
πάνακος (scilicet ὀπός) ὁμοίως, ὃν ἐν συνθέτῳ προσηγορίᾳ καλοῦσιν ὀποπάνακα
‘the juice of the πάναξ, which is designated by the compound ὀποπάναξ’. In a
similar manner, we find καρποβάλσαμον ‘the fruit of the balsam’ (Gal.) alternat-
ing with καρπὸς βαλσάμου (Gal. De antidotis libri ii 14.41.3–4). The use of καρπο-
in the FC might have been encouraged by its occurrence in verbal compounds
such as καρποφόρος ‘fruit-bearer’, but the creation of the compound in the first
place reflects the frequency of the phrase in the technical register of botany and
medicine.
     These plant names represent a coherent group displaying identical charac-
teristics and sharing a similar derivational process. It seems that they mark the
final stage of a process which first led pairs of words such as καρπὸς βαλσάμου or
ὄνος ἄγριος to become fixed expressions for the denomination of a certain plant,
plant derivate or animal, and then consolidated them as lexical units, i.e. as a
type of phrasal term.164 As argued by Langslow (2000: 206) in connection with
medical Latin, this is a frequent phenomenon in the creation of technical lan-
guages. The next step was the transformation of these phrasal terms into proper
compounds: again, this ties in with the well-known tendency of technical lan-
guages to coin a synthetic and transparent terminology.165 Writers of scientific
treatises are in a position to choose between the phrase and the compound on
the basis of considerations of style and register. It may be that these plant and
animal names which begin to be used in post-Classical Greek represent the relics
of a broader trend towards endowing Greek with a scientific language, according
to which nominalization supersedes syntax.166 Some of the FCs might therefore
function as convenient ‘tags’, iconic markers of a certain class of elements in the
scientific taxonomy. In this respect, Greek technical language seems to privilege
morphological patterns which are different from those used in other linguistic
registers.
7.4 Determinative compounds with a governing adjectival head
Another class which is commonly mentioned in descriptions of Greek left-oriented
compounds comprises forms in which the head is an adjective used as the FC:
ἰσόθεος ‘similar to a god’, ἀξιόλογος ‘worthy of mention’, ἀπειρομ́χᾱς ‘unused to
war’, ἀϊδροδ́κης ‘ignorant of law’, κένανδρος ‘empty of men’, ἐρημόπολις ‘bereft

of a city’, ὁμοιόκριθος ‘similar to barley’ and ἐμπειροπόλεμος ‘expert of war’. This
type is different from the preceding types, in that the forms in question cannot be
considered to be the ‘odd’ counterparts of established right-oriented ones, and
this is because right-oriented determinative compounds with an adjectival head
and a nominal modifier are marginal in Greek (sections 4.6–4.7).
     Some previous accounts connect these compounds to syntactic phrases of
the type ἴσος θεοῖσι ‘similar to the gods’, ἄξιος λόγου ‘worthy of mention’, without
much consideration of the mechanisms by which compounds might come to
be derived from these phrases.167 While the derivation of the compound from a
phrase is demonstrable in the case of some of these forms (e.g. ἰσόθεος), for most
for most of them no corresponding phrase is attested.168 Moreover, the syntactic
order of the attested phrases is by no means always of the adjective + noun kind.
     The left-oriented structure of these compounds is ruled by a combination of
morpho-syntactic criteria rather than by the mechanistic imitation of particular
phrases. The placement of the adjectival head on the left is due to the fact that
ἴσος, ἄξιος, ἄπειρος, ἔρημος, ἄϊδρις, etc. are directors, i.e. governing words which
require obligatory complements in order to be semantically complete: this is the
syntactic criterion behind their left-orientation. In this respect, these adjectives
behave in a similar way to prepositions and the resulting compounds exhibit
properties analogous to those of prepositional compounds, including the fact
that the SC may be modified by an adjectival suffix (ἀξιότιμ-ος ‘worthy of honour’
< ἄξιος + τιμή).169
     A subclass of this type converges still more closely with prepositions. These
are compounds in which the spatial adjectives μέσος ‘middle’ and ἄκρος ‘high’
behave as governing FCs with the meaning ‘in the middle of’ and ‘on top of’, as in
μεσόμφαλος ‘in mid-navel, central’ and in the noun ἀκρωμία ‘withers of a horse’
(< ‘on top of shoulders’).170
     While the properties displayed by all these adjectival FCs are influenced by
syntax, the resulting compounds are not simply condensed syntactic phrases: the
placement of the director in the FC ultimately follows the general morphological
rules of compound formation, since—as we have previously discussed—in Greek

169 Tribulato (2007: 543–544). With the exception of G. Meyer (1872: 14), most of the previous
discussions of these compounds fail to identify the governing nature of their FCs: see e.g. De-
brunner (1917: 43), Risch (1949: 106).
170 Risch (1945) mentions some of these compounds in his study of the process leading to the
derivation of those Zugehörigkeitsadjektiva (adjectives of pertinence) from phrases which are
marked by the suffixes -ιος or -ος, e.g. μέσαι νύκτες ‘midnight’ > μεσονύκτιος ‘at midnight’. How-
ever, he does not address the governing nature of their FCs.

there is a clear restriction on right-oriented compounded adjectives, the bulk of
which derive from phrases containing an accusative of respect.
7.5 Left-oriented V1 compounds and the question of their interpretation
The preceding overview shows that there are two very different types of left-
oriented compounds. On the one hand, some types represent the sporadic
inversion of established right-oriented types and are usually connected to spe-
cific registers, such as poetic style in the case of the forms discussed in 7.2.1 and
7.2.2, and scientific language in the case of the left-oriented animal and plant
names discussed in section 7.3. On the other hand, adjective-first compounds
do not really compete with any particular right-oriented type: they have their
origin in morphological constraints, and are also influenced by syntax, since
their heads are directors.
     A similar combination of word order patterns and morphological constraints
characterizes the formation and productivity of V1 compounds in Greek. These
compounds are marked by a FC deriving from a verb and a nominal SC function-
ing as the verb’s argument. The most common semantic role acquired by the SC
is that of direct object, with the FC expressing transitive or transitive-causative
semantics, and this can be observed in the two classic examples which will be
used throughout this book: φερέοικος ‘carry-house’ (an epithet used to describe
the snail in Hes. and nomadic peoples in Hdt.) and τερψίμβροτος ‘delighting
men’ (Hom.). However, V1 compounds may reflect the whole range of semantic
roles associated with the Greek verb, mirroring the semantics of the verbal base
from which they derive.171 The SC may therefore correspond to the indirect case
governed by the verb, as in πεισιχάλινος ‘obeying the rein’ (Pi.), which mirrors
the use of πείθομαι with the dative; or in ἁψίκορος ‘quickly-satiated’ (lit. ‘touch-
ing satiety’, Pl.), which corresponds to the construction of ἅπτομαι ‘touch, reach’
with the genitive. In a few isolated cases, the FC may acquire passive semantics:
the SC may then assume the semantic role of agent, as in ἀκουσίθεος ‘heard by
God’ (Antip. Thess.), or it may express a concomitant condition such as cause, as
in ἐρασιπλόκαμος ‘loved for the hair’ (Ibyc.). In a few more artificial compounds,
the verbal FC may express passive semantics but the SC, rather than function-
ing as the agent, would seem to be characterized by the FC: see for instance
στρεψίμαλλος ‘with tangled fleece’ (not ‘tangling the fleece’ or ‘twisted by the
fleece’) and στρεψίκερως ‘(antelope) with twisted horns’ (not ‘twisting the horns’
or ‘twisted by the horns’): on both forms, cf. Chapter 6, section 3.1.

     In Greek, the productivity of the V1 type is surprising, since its left-oriented
structure goes against the right-headed orientation of the language, and the fact
that the same combination of a verbal element and its argument is also expressed
by the standard right-oriented V2 type (e.g. οἰκοφόρος) may make the V1 type
appear redundant. Such productivity, which is without parallel, as far as we can
tell, among other ancient IE languages, calls for three approaches. The focus of
the first is on the origin of V1 compounds and the question of whether they are an
inherited type or should be analysed solely as a development peculiar to Greek.
The second approach is concerned with the morphological analysis of the FCs
and is intimately tied up with the question of the origin of the V1 type. The FCs
of the examples φερέοικος and τερψίμβροτος are structurally different, in that
the first can be described as containing the root of φέρω followed by -ε-, i.e. the
present stem, while the latter can be described as containing the stem of the s-ao-
rist of τέρπω ‘delight’ (ἔ-τερψ-α) followed by -ι-; or, alternatively, the stem of the
action noun τέρψις ‘enjoyment’. The morphological make-up of V1 compounds in
Greek has elicited a variety of interpretations. Some of them privilege a syntactic
analysis, according to which the FCs are analysed as the relics of inflected verbal
forms (Chapter 3, section 5), while others take the FCs to derive from verbal stems
(Chapter 3, sections 6 and 8). As a consequence of these differing approaches, the
literature on the topic contains widely varying interpretations of the PIE origin
and development of the V1 type(s), as well as their interaction with word order
and other compound types.
     The third approach focuses on the development of V1 compounds within
Greek in the light of its right-oriented compound system, and addresses a number
of key questions. Why do V1 compounds co-exist side by side with the more wide-
spread V2 type? Do they express different semantics from V2 compounds? Did
they arise to overcome morphological or structural constraints associated with
the V2 type?172 The methodological assumption adopted in this book is that, in
order to explain why these V1 ‘exceptions’ exist and are relatively productive in a
right-headed language such as Greek, they need to be investigated from the point
of view of their structural and semantic relation to the V2 type (an approach with
we have similarly applied to the description of the other left-oriented categories
described above), as well as from the point of view of their use in context.
172 Namer and Villoing (2007) explore similar questions in their comparison of the morphological
processes behind French V1 and V2 compounds. However, their use and understanding of the
AG data, is seriously mistaken: for instance, they believe that [N V] compounds may have been
lacking in AG!

7.5.1 The FC of V1 compounds: descriptive overview
φερέοικος V1 compounds are characterized by a verbal FC ending in -ε- or, much
more rarely, in -ο- (e.g. λιπότεκνος ‘lacking children, childless’, Pi.), -α- (e.g.
ταλαπενθής ‘bearing grief’, Hom.), -υ- (e.g. Ἐρύλαος ‘defending his people’,
Hom.), -η- (e.g. Τληπόλεμος ‘enduring war’, Hom.) and -ι- (e.g. ἀρχιτέκτων
‘chief-builder’, Hdt.).173 In practical terms, this category tends to be defined in
opposition to the second category of Greek V1 compounds, namely those whose
FC is characterized by -σ-.
      τερψ́μβροτος compounds are identified by the -σι- element and its com-
binations with velars and labials (-ξι, -ψι); and, more sporadically, by -σε-
(περσέπτολις ‘conquering cities’ < πέρθω ‘to conquer’), -σο- ( ̓Αμευσόπολις ‘con-
quering cities’ < ἀμεύσασθαι ‘to conquer’), -εσι- (ἑλκεσίπεπλος ‘trailing the robe’ <
ἕλκω ‘to trail’) or -ησι- (εὑρησιεπής ‘finding words, inventive of words’ < εὑρίσκω
‘to find’). Chapter 4, section 4.1, investigates the analogical nature of these con-
stituents in -εσι-, -ησι-, -σε- and -σο-. A much thornier problem is represented by
the few FCs ending in -τι- (βωτιάνειρα ‘feeding men’ < βόσκω ‘to feed’), which are
mostly attested in Mycenaean or in Homeric Greek. Indeed, our interpretation of
the τερψ́μβροτος type turns out to depend on how we understand this kind of
FC, which finds parallels in Vedic forms such as dti-vara- ‘giving riches’ (Chapter
4, section 4.3.2).
      As Chapter 3 shows in detail, hypotheses on the origin of the V1 type pivot on
the analysis of the FCs, and in particular on their final vocalic element. There are
two basic trends: the first interprets these vocalic elements as inflectional relics,
originally belonging to inflected verbal forms or (in the case of τερψ́μβροτος
compounds only) as parts of nominal suffixes; the second trend considers these
vowels as linking elements, which have the function of making Kompositionsfuge
easier and are devoid of any special semantic function. We will return to these
issues in the next two chapters.
7.5.2 Productivity of Ancient Greek V1 compounds
This question of the origin of the type is irrelevant to the diachronic development
of V1 compounds in Greek. Speakers developed an internal derivational process
according to which τερψ́μβροτος compounds were mostly based on sigmatic
tenses (principally the aorist), while φερέοικος compounds were mostly based
on thematic presents or aorists. Although this derivational chain includes many
173 -ι- is based on the analogy of τερψίμβροτος compounds, as argued in Chapter 4, section
3.2. One also finds -αι- in compounds from τλῆναι, where ταλαι- provides a metrical alternative
to ταλα-.

exceptions, it is fundamentally stable: therefore, in order to understand the crea-
tion of certain V1 compounds or the popularity of others, and particularly the way
in these interact with existing or non-existing V2 compounds, it is necessary to
study the relationship between the compounds and their verbal bases.
     On the whole, V1 compounds are used in all linguistic registers. However,
they are particularly common in onomastics and poetry (where they are mostly
used as epithets), and also occur in the technical register of medical and astro-
nomical texts. When used as PNs or epithets, V1 compounds describe an indi-
vidual by reference to through his/her characterizing action. It has been claimed
that this sort of onomastic formations reflect wishes and this may well be true,
although it would not be advisable to infer from this basic observation (which
also applies to names expressing qualities such as ‘good’ or ‘beautiful’, or com-
paring humans to animals) that the FCs of V1 compounds go back to old impera-
tives or desideratives (Chapter 3, sections 5 and 6). Similarly, the high frequency
of V1 compounds in onomastics should not be used to infer that the type must
have originated within onomastics and was later transferred to the non-onomas-
tic lexicon: the interaction between onomastics and other spheres of a language
is never unidirectional (see section 8 below). More probably, the onomastic use
is a specialization of a type which arose for the adjectival description of individ-
uals performing actions, as opposed to types which named those individuals by
means of substantival compound types.
7.5.3 Exocentricity of V1 compounds
The preceding paragraph leads us on to another identifying characteristic of V1
compounds cross-linguistically which we ought to address briefly: their exocen-
tric character. AG V1 compounds are mostly used as adjectives and this is usually
marked by the suffix -ος/-ον, as in ἐχέκολλος ‘sticky’ (lit. ‘containing glue’,
Hippocr.) < κόλλα ‘glue’; V1 compounds with a neuter sigmatic stem in the SC
regularly take the suffix -ής, e.g.  ̓Εχεμένης ‘having strength’ < μένος ‘strength’.
Depending on the shape of the SC, the adjectival status of the compound may
also be signalled through other devices: consider ἐχέφρων ‘prudent’ (lit. ‘having
mind’) vs. φρήν ‘mind’ (where derivation is signalled by the choice of a different
vocalic grade); or ἐχενηίς ‘ship-holding’ vs. ναῦς (where derivation is signalled
by the feminine suffix -ίς). Substantival V1 compounds do exist, but they are
always derived nouns (e.g. ἐχεμυθία ‘silence’ < ἐχέμυθος ‘someone who holds
back words’).
     V1 compounds ought therefore to be regarded as headless. Semantically, the
governing FCs are the fixed element of the compound, which the SCs in some way
‘modify’ by providing different arguments: as such―it may be argued―the FC is

118           Chapter Two – The Compound Categories of Ancient Greek
a sort of determinatum and thus a sort of semantic head. Because clear terminol-
ogy for defining these properties of the FC of V1 compounds is lacking, the term
‘head’ is sometimes used in reference to the verbal FC of V1 compounds. However,
this usage is highly controversial, since some linguists would argue that the FC
does not display the typical properties of heads, such as the determination of
the grammatical category of the compound itself. This is a particularly cogent
objection in connection with the φερέοικος type, as its FC cannot be interpreted
as deriving from a noun at all (we have already mentioned that the morphological
analysis of the FC of τερψ́μβροτος compounds is controversial): since it is a stem,
and not a noun, its identification with the head is problematic.174
7.5.4 Left-orientation and word order patterns
As in the case of the other left-oriented compound categories of Greek, the main
question concerning the structure of V1 compounds is why they have been
created as such. As already mentioned, this question is particularly pressing in
connection with a language such as Greek, in which not only is compounding
overwhelmingly right-headed, but there also exists a very large and productive
category of right-oriented V2 compounds. The question can in fact be subdivided
into two further questions. The first concerns the morphological (and perhaps
also syntactic) mechanisms which determined the survival and popularity of
left-oriented V1 compounds in the Greek right-oriented compound system. This
synchronic question has never been addressed in earnest, requiring as it does
a comprehensive analysis of V1 compound families in their relationship with V2
types, and such an analysis is the goal of the present volume. The second ques-
tion concerns the morphological and syntactic mechanisms which influenced the
birth of the left-oriented V1 type in the proto-language: this historical question is
usually addressed from a comparative and typological point view, in the light of
PIE word order and its diachronic development.
174 The issue has been debated regarding modern V1 compounds: for a general appraisal,
see Scalise and Fábregas (2010: 113–114). Endocentric analysis of V1 compounds, particular-
ly in Romance languages, is discussed in several contributions, including Di Sciullo and Wil-
liams (1987), Lieber (1992: 66–67), Bisetto (1994), Scalise, Bisetto and Guevara (2005: 140–141),
Schroten (2010: 91). It should be noted, however, that in the frameworks adopted in some of
these contributions, the verbal FC is considered to be a noun (derived from a verb through ze-
ro-morpheme suffixation), not a verb or a verbal stem, and this poses problems for Greek in that
there is a good chance that the FC of Greek V1 compounds is, quite simply, a stem or a root. I
used the term ‘head’ for the description of Greek V1 compounds in Tribulato (2006) and Tribulato
(2007); this term is here avoided on account of the difficulties discussed above.

     In most IE languages, with the exception of the Romance branch, right-ori-
ented compounds are the majority.175 Indo-Europeanists have tended to explain
this state of affairs by reference to the fact that the basic (unmarked) word order
in PIE seems to have been of the SOV type, i.e. with modifying items preceding
the modified element(s).176 Accordingly, the hypothesis is that left-oriented com-
pounds reflect marked word order (VOS), and this theory has been used to account
for V1 compounds in particular.177 In some studies, the interaction between these
two inherited types is also seen in chronological terms: V2 compounds reflect
a pre-inflectional stage of PIE, in which determination was signalled simply by
word order, whereas V1 compounds reflect a later stage, in which determination
and other syntactic functions were expressed through endings.178
     In this connection, a popular view since the nineteenth century has been
that V1 compounds arose from PIE imperatival phrases, in which the verb took
the first position: accordingly, the FC of V1 compounds has been identified with
an inflected imperative, a hypothesis which has won support from the likes of
Jacobi, Delbrück, Brugmann and Wackernagel and which is discussed in Chapter
3, section 5.179 Studies of V1 compounds in the ancient IE languages now gen-
erally prefer to interpret the FCs of V1 compounds as stems or (in the case of
τερψ́μβροτος compounds) as verbal nouns, but the imperatival hypothesis
continues to hold ground in analyses of modern V1 compounds, particularly in
relation to Romance.180 These studies have contributed useful insights regarding
the reconstruction of PIE syntax and its connection with the structure of V1 com-
pounds at that linguistic stage, but they fail to explain the factors at play in the
Greek compound system, in which both the V1 and the V2 types are productive.
     When transferred to Greek, the debate on the impact of word order patterns
on compounding takes on a different significance. Classical Greek word order is
notoriously very free, and this freedom, which earlier research mostly linked to
stylistics, is now also analysed in pragmatic terms.181 The view that SOV may still
be the basic word order in AG, as opposed to the more pronounced shift to SVO in
175 Pollack (1912: 62–64), followed by Tischler (1979: 857).
176 This was recognized as early as Delbrück (1878: 76–78). The application of this theory to the
analysis of IE compounding is discussed in Lehmann (1969: 10–11) and Tischler (1979: 858, 865).

MG, is considered controversial by some scholars on the basis of the very differ-
ent approaches adopted in assessing the data.182 The evidence provided by com-
pounds may speak in favour of the hypothesis that SOV continued to be the basic
order in AG, since in compounds the determiner overwhelmingly occurs at the left
of the head, but this argument runs a serious risk of being circular.183
     Accordingly, the presence of V1 compounds in Greek can be viewed in two
different ways. The first view adopts a diachronic perspective, according to which
Greek V1 compounds reflect a particular PIE word order (whatever its real moti-
vations) that places the verb before its object. The markedness of this pattern
would thus be carried over in Greek compounding: in other words, left-orienta-
tion would be a relic, preserved in particular areas of the lexicon.184 The fact that
V1 compounds are very common in Greek onomastics is used by some scholars to
support the thesis that the pattern originally expressed a marked word order, in
which an imperative, used to express a wish for the new-born, was placed first in
the phrase.185 In the remaining areas of the lexicon, this original function would
have been lost and V1 compounds would simply represent reversed, and to an
extent ‘odd’, counterparts of the V2 type.
     Concerning the connection between syntactic word order and compound ori-
entation, we should pay attention to the pioneering ideas expressed by Andriotis
(1938) in the only diachronic study of Greek ‘reversed’ compounds to extend as far
forward as MG. Andriotis was persuaded that V1 compounds were inherited, but
he also criticized both the idea that in Greek they were specialized as an onomas-
tic pattern, kept alive by the onomastic tendency to create reversed names, and
the idea that in the appellative lexicon V1 compounds were tied to a different sty-
listic level than V2 compounds.186 In particular, he paid due attention to the fact
that the V1 type (together with other types of left-oriented compounds) remained
productive throughout the Byzantine period and down to the modern language, a
fact which he interpreted to mean—in my view correctly—that the V1 type was not
182 For the idea that SOV remains more basic in AG, see Dover (1960: 2–3); for the idea that
the basic word order is SVO already in AG, see Delbrück (1900: 80–83). The range of differing
positions on the topic is summarized in the bibliographical overview in Debrunner (1950: 695).
For the standard view that the MG order is basically of the SVO type, see Thumb (1910: 191–192).
However, there has recently been considerable debate concerning the phenomena triggering the
SVO order in MG and even on whether this order should be considered ‘canonical’ at all. Studies
in this direction have been conducted by Philippaki-Warburton (1985) and Horrocks (1994).
183 Andriotis (1938: 92–93) states this overtly.
184 This is more or less the view expressed by Andriotis (1938: 93–95).

a mere stylistic device, but a linguistic tool authentically employed in common
language as well.187
     Andriotis’ account is a good representative of the second way of viewing to
V1 compounds in Greek, which seeks to find internal mechanisms to explain the
presence and popularity of this left-oriented type in the language. Efforts have
been focused on identifying the specific semantic or functional properties which
V1 compounds express within Greek, as opposed to those expressed by V2 com-
pounds. Andriotis himself was actually sceptical about the possibility of iden-
tifying a semantic and functional differentiation between the two types which,
in his view, were simply distinguished by a contrasting structure. Others have
put forward more ambitious theories which, it should be noted, have not been
tested on a comprehensive corpus of verbal compounds. The most influential of
these theories was advanced by Benveniste (1967). In his view, V1 and V2 com-
pounds are not free variations of one another: V1 compounds express ‘la réalité
du procès’ and signify the verbal action ‘comme activité constatée’, thus corre-
sponding to a description;188 whereas V2 compounds simply correspond to an
atemporal definition of a given action and express a ‘qualité permanente’.189 It
is important to take note of the famous assumption which Benveniste’s analysis
takes as its starting point, namely that compounding is a ‘mycro-syntax’: accord-
ingly, Greek compounds and their structure are seen as the transformation of
free syntactic utterances, and not as crystallized morphological patterns which
predate Greek itself.190 Although Benveniste does not address the issue of orienta-
tion, his hypothesis can be further interpreted as suggesting that V1 compounds
are opposed—as a ‘marked’ pattern provided with ‘marked’ semantics—to V2
compounds, which simply state a fact.
     Benveniste’s hypothesis has often been cited and made use of in accounts
of Greek compounding, but the truth remains that neither his short article nor
subsequent studies have been able to prove the semantic and functional reparti-
tion which he hypothesizes: on the contrary, the cursory examinations to which
individual compound pairs have been subjected tend to disprove Benveniste’s
claim.191 In Chapter 3 we will return to this syntactic approach and to Benven-
iste’s conclusion that compounds have the function of transferring the predica-

tion enunciated by syntactic propositions to a ‘virtual level’.192 As concerns V1
compounds, Benveniste is right to criticize the view that V1 and V2 compounds
are free variants of one another (which was more or less Andriotis’ conclusion).
The analysis of the other left-oriented types advanced in this chapter corroborates
Benveniste’s criticism, since all productive left-oriented types are not mere inver-
sions of right-oriented types, but are justified by morpho-syntactic factors. Like
Andriotis, Benveniste also finds fault with another prevalent view which sees V1
compounds as mere stylistic variants of V2 compounds. As Chapters 5–6 show,
a degree of stylistic variation is suggested by the interaction of many individual
compound pairs, particularly when the V2 specimen has acquired a semantic
specialization which links it to technical or low-level registers. However, it would
be wrong to conclude that V1 compounds are always poetic or elevated and that
V2 compounds are tied to everyday language: the stylistic repartition must be
judged separately for each individual compound family, and in fact often on a
pair-by-pair basis.
     As we have seen, Benveniste’s response to older hypotheses is to find a
semantic solution, according to which V1 compounds correspond to syntactic
enunciates containing presents expressing a description, while V2 compounds
correspond to phrases containing presents which express a definition. In the
analysis proposed in this volume, by contrast, the interaction between V1 and
V2 compounds is explained through a combination of factors, ranging from mor-
phology to semantics and syntax. These factors are: the shape of the verbal root
lying behind the compounds and the morphological constraints associated with
it (particularly in the creation of V2 compounds), i.e. morphology; the specific
meaning(s) of the base verbs and how this or these may be expressed through the
interaction between different compound types, i.e. semantics; and the relation to
attested Greek phrases, the connections which they create between concepts and
between the words which express them, and the syntactic order in which these
words are placed.
8 Onomastics and compounds
The previous section referred to theories which connect the origin of V1 com-
pounds to onomastics. It is now time to say a few general words about the mech-
anisms ruling AG onomastics as a useful preliminary to the in-depth assessment
of the theories which are discussed in Chapter 3, as well as to the study of individ-
ual V1 types. The Greek naming system was one of the most creative areas of the

Greek language, and there were very few rules restricting the kind of word or stem
that could be used to form a PN.193 From a structural point of view, three different
types of names can be distinguished: compounded PNs (also called ‘dithematic
names’, e.g. Πατροκλέης and Σωσίπολις), abbreviated names derived from them
(the so-called Kurznamen or hypocoristics, e.g. Πάτροκλος and Σωσίας), and
monothematic names which do not derive from dithematic forms (the so-called
sobriquets, e.g. Ἀγάθων ‘the good one’).194
     The traditional stance on Greek onomastics, represented for instance by
Bechtel and Fick (1894), is that all Greek names were originally dithematic (i.e.
compounded) and that monothematic names arose only as a result of their short-
ening. Recent work inclines towards a more moderate view, allowing that Greek
possessed originally dithematic names, as well as originally monothematic ones,
and that only a portion of monothematic names were created by shortening of
dithematic forms.195 It has been suggested (most notably by Pulgram (1947)) that
the structure of Greek PNs reflects social divisions, whereby members of the aris-
tocracy possessed compounded names while monothematic names were used by
the lower classes, but this assumption is unwarranted.196
     Before assessing the possible role of onomastics in the origin and/or devel-
opment of V1 compounds in Greek, we need to consider some more general prob-
lems. One of them is whether or not PNs represent a linguistic realm that obeys
completely different rules from those governing other lexemes (appellatives):
much of the work that can be done on the morphology of names depends on
how this question is answered. It is frequently remarked that PNs tend to be more
conservative than other lexical items. This statement is in part correct, and it is
supported by the cross-linguistic wealth of PNs whose shape and phonology have
resisted the changes undergone by lexical words. At the same time, however,
certain PNs can evolve in ways that are out of keeping with the rest of the lan-
guage, and display original forms of morphological innovation.197 Examples of
both phenomena are provided by Morpurgo Davies (2000: 16–17). The English
names Ethel, Audrey, and Etheldreda are all developments of the same original
form ÆðelÞryd: this shows that PNs, like other words, may change their phono-
logical shape, but, unlike other words, they do not have to reach a standardized
form. PNs may also defy the normal rules of word formation, as is shown by the

Greek creation of the feminine Διοδότη out of a morphological class (verbal adjec-
tives) which in the appellative lexicon does not have a separate feminine form.198
     Trends towards innovation or conservatism within onomastics also vary
according to period and geographical area.199 A given form may be more conserv-
ative in a given region because of specific historical and socio-linguistic condi-
tions, such as the perpetuation of the local god’s or king’s name, or the wish
to preserve communal identity through PNs.200 On the other hand, the desire to
expunge the memory of a given person may lead a community to suddenly drop
the use of a name,201 while other regions may be more prone to accept new names
because of their proximity to foreign lands, or because of the multilingual nature
of their community.202 The widespread notion that V1 compounds are used in
onomastics because they are linguistic relics, appropriate to an intrinsically con-
servative area of language, must therefore be reviewed in light of the fact that
naming practices are also characterized by innovative trends.
     As concerns the mutual influence of the onomastic and appellative lexi-
cons, here too a number of distinctions must be made. From the point of view
of morphology, both linguistic realms exploit compounding as a means of word
formation; in onomastics, however, we have seen that special short forms can
be derived from compound names by taking part of the compound and adding a
special suffix to it, e.g. Σώσιλος from Σωσίλᾱος. Although most of these suffixes
in themselves are not confined to onomastics (e.g. -ος, -ιος, -ας, -ίας, -ᾶς, -(ί)ων,
-εύς, -έας, -ις, -μος, and -ώ, -ιδ- for women), their use as a means of deriving hypo-
coristics is exclusive to onomastics: we are here faced with an area of the language
partly governed by specific morphological mechanisms. As concerns semantics,
we must reflect on the fact that onomastics experiences very few constraints as to
what is compoundable, and the result is the mass of seemingly meaningless com-
pounded names that we come across in Greek. This freedom is a consequence of
the fact that names, unlike appellatives, do not necessarily need to obey semantic
structures in order to ‘speak’ to us: thus a name formed by elements of both the
father’s and mother’s side may have no structural ‘meaning’ and yet be trans-
parent in what it represents or evokes. These examples help to bring out the fact
that although onomastics may be characterized by linguistic mechanisms which
are specific to it, it is not possible to identify a single factor which would support
198 See also Morpurgo Davies (1999: 391).

Attica: see Morpurgo Davies (1999: 393–396).

the claim that a given compound type must have originated as onomastic and
only later been extended to the appellative lexicon. There is certainly a good deal
of exchange between onomastics and common language. Scholars often assume
that the exchange is monodirectional, with onomastic patterns permeating the
appellative lexicon as suggested for instance by Frei-Lüthy (1978), but the wealth
of Greek names derived from common language, such as Λύκος ‘Wolf’, Ἀγ́θων
‘The good one’, etc. (arguably nicknames in origin), shows that the opposite phe-
nomenon was much more frequent.
8.1 Onomastics and V1 compounds
The focus of the present book is solely on compounded PNs of the V1 type, and
on their shortened forms. Examples of both are already found in Mycenaean (see
Chapter 4, sections 5 and 7), and the numerous attestations of this type across
Greece show that the V1 type remained productive for the whole of AG linguis-
tic history. Many of these names reflect two-member phrases attested in the
language, often in the context of poetic phraseology. The investigation of these
parallels is useful in order to clarify the authentic meaning of a given name and
has often been carried out by scholars, although no comprehensive study of the
impact of Greek phraseology on compounded PNs has ever been undertaken:
good examples of the results which can be achieved with this methodology come
from the many contributions by J. L. García Ramón on Greek (particularly Myce-
naean) onomastics, which will often be drawn upon for our analysis of V1 PNs.203
     At the same time, we should not neglect hypocoristics. These are especially
important in the case of verbs which do not have a rich V1 compound family,
since they prove the existence of FCs which are never found in fully compounded
forms. Identifying those which may go back to a name of the τερψίμβροτος type
is easier thanks to the s-marker attached to these compounds: hypocoristics in
-σευς, -σων, -σιων, -σιας (and their combinations with occlusives) may have orig-
inated as FCs of V1 compounds. Examples from the Corpus include for instance
 ̓Αμειψίας, Βλεψίας, and Βρύσων, all probably going back to compounded names
of the τερψίμβροτος type derived from ἀμείβω, βλέπτω and βρύω.204 Recognizing
203 On phraseology in particular, see Chapter 3, section 7; Chapter 6, section 6.3.
204 Other examples are discussed for instance by Morpurgo Davies (2000: 36–38) and García
Ramón (1992). Matters are particularly difficult with Mycenaean hypocoristics given the ambiguous
Mycenaean spelling: individual Mycenaean forms identified as hypocoristics of V1 compounds
are discussed by Heubeck (1957a) and Heubeck (1957b), Perpillou (1973: 222–223), Morpurgo
Davies (1999: 399).

hypocoristics derived from φερέοικος compounds is harder, as virtually any mon-
othematic name displaying a verbal stem may be interpreted as the hypocoristic
of a V1 compound.205 The Corpus, which represents the first collection of V1 com-
pounds down to the sixth century AD (with forays into Byzantine Greek), system-
atically collects instances of V1 PNs attested in Greek inscriptions. However, the
Corpus only includes the first chronological attestation of the combination of a
verb (e.g. ἄρχω) and a given noun (e.g. δίκη, λαός) and does not aim to provide a
comprehensive collection of their formal variations (e.g. FCs ending in -ι and -o),
dialectal forms (e.g. with the SCs -δίκᾱ or -λεως), hypocoristics or derivations (e.g.
feminine forms in -εια). In each case, the form entered in the Corpus (regardless
of whether it is a compound, hypocoristic or derivation, and whatever its dialec-
tal colouring) is the most ancient one: for example, in the onomastic forms from
ἄρχω the feminine name Ἀρχεδίκᾱ (Thessaly, 7th c.) is preferred to its Attic-Ionic
counterpart Ἀρχεδίκη and to the masculine form Ἀρχέδικος because it is attested
earlier. The collection is therefore intended to provide the fullest possible range
of individual types of PNs, with the aim of studying the productivity of the various
compound families: the formal variations of each PN should be investigated sep-
arately in the LGPN or other onomastic corpora.
9 Compound verbs
The preceding analysis of compound types does not include compound verbs
such as ἐπιγράφω ‘to inscribe’, which originate from the joining of a preposition/
adverb (ἐπί ‘on’) to a verb (γράφω ‘to write’). In that respect, this overview is in
line with the tradition of studies of Greek compounding, which tends to exclude
such forms from compounding since their historical origin can be traced back to
a situation where adverb and verb were independent (the phenomenon known
as ‘tmesis’ which is still prominently attested in Homeric Greek).206 How this type
of form is assessed may differ depending on the approach adopted, since these
verbs often represent borderline cases between compounding and prefixation:
the issue is debated with particular vigour concerning English compounds such
as overcome and take off.207 Like all other Greek verbs, these preverbed forms are
at the root of a large number of verbal nouns in both Ancient and Modern Greek,

e.g. ἐπιγραφή ‘inscription’, ἐπιγραφεύς ‘inscriber’, ἐπίγραμμα ‘inscription’: these
too are excluded from accounts of compounding proper, since they are formed
through derivation from a base form, rather than through compounding. In our
investigation of verbal compounds, individual examples of prefixed derivations
will be brought into the picture when they provide information on the deriva-
tional mechanisms of certain verbs: we will particularly pay attention to prefixed
agent nouns such as ἐξεγέρτης ‘one who arouses’ and ἐπιλοιπός ‘remaining’ in
Chapter 5, which deals with various classes of V1 compounds for which no corre-
sponding V2 compounds are attested.
     MG also has a common type of coordinative [V V]v compound (of controver-
sial headedness) exemplified by τρωγοπίνω [eat drink] or ανοιγοκλίνω [open
close], a type which is entirely absent in AG and seem to have arisen in the lan-
guage only around the fourteenth century (see section 2.2).208 According to Ralli
(2013: 172), ‘the emergence of this type of compounds, which makes Greek unique
among the Indo-European languages, is an instantiation of a grammatical need
to respond to the rise of productivity of compounding in general and coordina-
tive compounding more particularly; it filled an empty slot in the coordinative
patterns of the language, that is, the slot based on the category of verbs’. Ralli
further argues that [V V]v compounds may also be linked to the growth of parat-
actic structures in the language.
     It is left for us to assess another type of structure represented by denomina-
tive verbs of the type ἀδικέω ‘I act unjustly’ which are not compound forms of
the verbal base (there is no **δικέω ‘to be just’ in AG), but derive, through con-
version, from compounded nouns and adjectives such as ἄδικος ‘unjust’.209 This
original developmental chain, which at the first stage requires the existence of
the bahuvrihi ἄδικος, is also responsible for the creation of secondary compound
verbs from nominal verbal compounds, e.g. εὐεργέτης (compound of εὖ ‘well’
and the verbal stem ἐργ- ‘to work’) > εὐεργετέω ‘to be a benefactor’. A similar
development is also assumed for English [N V]V structures such as baby-sit and
stage-manage, which are back-formations of the synthetic compounds baby-sitter
and stage-manager.210
     The morphological issues at stake in the interpretation of this category of verbs
are many and they have been recently studied by Grandi and Pompei (2012), who
draw particular attention to the fact that ‘the formation of complex verbs ending
in -éō is a process at the centre of an intricate net of interactions between various

derivational and compounding processes’.211 This derivational net apparently
enabled the formation of -έω verbs even in the absence of a preceding compound,
to the point that the [N V]V type has become a productive class of compounds
in MG.212 In this volume, [N V]V complex verbs will be brought into the picture
when they derive from V1 compounds: for instance, the adjective μνησίκακος is
the basis for the technical verb of interstate treaties, (μὴ) μνησικακέω ‘to pass an
act of amnesty’. However, the Corpus does not systematically include derivations
(either verbal or nominal) of V1 compounds, since the focus of this volume is not
on the derivational process instantiated by the V1 type in AG.
10 The use of compounds in Ancient Greek
The variety and vitality of the compound types discussed in this chapter ought to
have already made it clear that compounds are a fundamental part of the lexicon
at every stage of the Greek language. As concerns AG, an obvious problem is the
faulty nature of our documentation, which in particular does not allow us to form
a good idea of the oral component of the language. Both in terms of the number of
texts and the amount of research devoted to them, the analysis of AG compound-
ing is usually biased towards literary language, particularly poetry. In turn, this
may lead to conclusions on the use of compounds which need to be carefully
assessed. Consider for instance the following statement:
     La langue populaire n’emploie guère la composition. Les textes littéraires présentent en
     général d’autant plus de composés qu’ils s’éloignent davantage de l’usage courant. Le
     composé a le plus souvent quelque chose d’artificiel; il convient aux langues spéciales et
     techniques de la philosophie, de la science [...] auxquelles il confère à la fois précision et
     gravité. C’est surtout la langue poétique qui en fait usage. Les poètes qui se piquent d’un
     langage noble et veulent atteindre un ton élevé, obtiennent l’effet cherché en employant
     des composés.
     Meillet and Vendryès (1960: 421).
This short paragraph by two eminent Classical linguists contains some obvious
truths, but also a few generalizations.213 That compounds are numerous in poetry
is hardly surprising, given its preference for economy of style and incisive, con-
211 Grandi and Pompei (2012: 408).
212 Ralli (2013: 174).
213 By contrast, Kühner and Blass (1892: 312) saw that ‘in der griechischen Kompositionen
hingegen thut sich durchweg eine natürliche, lebenskräftige Entwicklung’, which would give
Greek compounds their ‘schönste Masshaltung, die grösste Leichtigkeit, Gewandtheit, Durch-
sichtigkeit und Klarheit’.

densed modes of expression: for a study in this direction, see the monograph
by Meyer (1923). We have seen above (section 7.3) that the same reasons lead to
the use of compounds and to the development of specific compound types in
scientific language. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine on what grounds
Meillet and Vendryès can have reached the bold conclusion with which they begin
their paragraph, namely that ‘popular language scarcely employs compounding’.
Greek literary texts also employ compounds which do not have an especially
poetic flavour, and which are simultaneously attested on inscriptions: it is a rea-
sonable supposition that they were common in spoken language too.214 Given the
lack of any oral source, to speak of a Greek ‘langue populaire’ and ‘usage courant’
in such uncritical terms is a paradox which requires many provisos, such as the
recognition that our reconstruction of a ‘popular’ or ‘spoken’ language necessar-
ily relies mostly on literary texts (particularly comedy, iambic poetry and oratory)
and more rarely on documentary papyri (unavailable for Archaic and Classical
Greek) and a few epigraphic genres (ostraka, defixiones...). An investigation of
these texts, and of inscriptions in particular, shows that compounds are indeed
found in non-literary documents such as laws, dedications, and private letters,
and that apart from a very few exceptions (which require more careful consid-
eration) all compound categories are attested in both literary and non-literary
documents.215
     We must also take into account the fact that compounding remains a very
productive means of word formation in MG and that many ancient types are
maintained in the modern language, facts which cannot be attributed only to the
influence of high-level literary language. In particular, the evidence from MG has
been used to prove that many left-oriented types, including V1 compounds, were
not learned marginal types in the ancient language, but must have had a life in
lower linguistic levels as well.216 In light of this diachronic perspective, the inves-
tigation of V1 compounds undertaken in this book will at times bring out the pat-
terns through which certain compound families have developed in AG, remaining
productive types throughout the history of the language.

130          Chapter Two – The Compound Categories of Ancient Greek
11 Conclusion
The examination of Greek compound categories provided in this chapter had two
aims. The first was to provide a set of references against which both the peculiari-
ties of the AG compound system and its similarities with those of other languages
can be investigated. The second was to describe, in the most comprehensive
manner possible, the characteristics of the system in which the compound type
investigated in this book, that of V1 compounds, finds its place. The overview of
compound categories has illustrated that Greek has a right-oriented compound
system in which a number of left-oriented formations, including V1 compounds,
are admitted. The investigation of endocentric determinative and verbal com-
pounds has allowed us to conclude that Greek seems to have developed towards
a more markedly endocentric system than previously thought. Four events con-
tributed to this evolution:
– The gradual abandonment of root verbal compounds, which are ambiguous
     from the point of view of headedness and semantics (sections 6.1 and 6.9).
– The parallel development of the class of V2 compounds in -ος (section 6.3).
– The creation of a new class of agentive compound nouns in -της (section 6.4).
– The development of endocentric determinative compounds, with the excep-
     tion of those with an adjectival SC, which remain rarer in Greek (sections 4.7
     and 4.9).
Neither the issue of the headedness of AG compounds, nor the structural char-
acteristics of the left-oriented categories, have previously been examined in suf-
ficient detail. As this chapter argues, only some of the left-oriented forms can
be regarded as singularities, while others are tied to specific morpho-syntactic
constraints. As concerns the orientation of Greek V1 compounds, we have briefly
addressed the theories put forward to explain its oddity. In general, most of these
theories tend to link the existence of this left-oriented type to the fact that it is a
relic from an older linguistic stage and/or to the supposition that V1 compounds
were originally confined to the onomastic lexicon. However, the strong produc-
tivity of various subtypes of V1 compounds outside onomastics, together with the
fact that they survive into MG, encourages the adoption of a different approach to
analysing their presence in AG.
     The example of other left-oriented categories suggests that V1 compounds,
whatever their origin, exist and continue to be productive throughout the history
of AG precisely to fill the morphological and semantic gaps left by the pervasive
right-oriented type. Chapters 4–6 of this volume are devoted to the identification
of the factors which brought it about that, rather than being an optional coun-
terpart of V2 compounds, V1 compounds were often the only, or the best, means

of providing the language with an active verbal compound. At the same time,
in order to fully grasp the issues at play in the development of the V1 type, it
is also necessary to investigate the morphological make-up and function of the
earliest attested compounds and attempt to understand them in the light of a
possible diachronic evolution which may have had its roots in the parent lan-
guage. Chapter 4 is devoted to the investigation of this comparative side of the
question, in the context of the diachronic development of V1 compounds from
Mycenaean to Archaic Greek. The necessary theoretical background to the com-
parative question is provided by the individual studies devoted to V1 compounds
in the last two centuries and by the analyses which have been advanced in the
context of larger investigations of Greek and IE morphology, word formation and
even syntax: Chapter 3 provides an overview of these antecedents in view of their
relevance to the present investigation.

Chapter Three –
The Study of Ancient Greek and Indo-European
V1 Compounds in the Last Two Centuries
1 Introduction
The origin, morphology and semantics of the Greek V1 types φερέοικος and
τερψ́μβροτος have been much debated in the last two centuries and remain
central topics in the investigation of IE compounding. A survey of the previous
works that addressed these compound types proves very useful for an under-
standing of the methodological questions concerning their analysis in Greek,
and the trends that have influenced the scholarly debate over the years. Analyses
have generally revolved around four areas of interest:
– The morphological and hence semantic interpretation of the FC and of the
     elements -ε-, -(τ)ι-, -(σ)ι- and -o-;
– The links between the FC and the Greek verbal system;
– The influence of syntax in the make-up of V1 compounds vis-à-vis V2 com-
     pounds;
– The use of V1 compounds in the context of Greek literary texts.
The first three topics have led scholars to consider a wider perspective, investi-
gating the parallels for V1 compounds in other IE languages, and hence inquiring
whether they might be an inherited category. In the early stages of comparative
linguistics these issues were often central to studies of the PIE verb and noun,
as well as syntax and onomastics. Although many of the topics discussed in this
chapter presuppose fairly detailed knowledge of morphological issues concern-
ing Greek V1 compounds, consideration of previous scholarship on the category
is by no means superfluous: on the contrary, it is essential as a means to clear the
ground for the fresher analysis of AG V1 compounds provided in Chapters 5 and
6 of this book. The investigation of Greek V1 compounds in the last two centuries
2 The investigation of Greek V1 compounds in the last two
2 centuries: preliminary considerations
The modern study of Greek V1 compounds goes back to the late nineteenth
century. The first scholar to produce a monograph on Greek verbal compounds
was Wilhelm Clemm, with a Giessen Habilitationsschrift entitled De compositis
                                                                                                       Olga Tribulato - 9783110415827

134          Chapter Three – The Study of Ancient Greek and Indo-European V1 Compounds
graecis quae a verbis incipiunt (1867). Since then, all the studies and contribu-
tions on the topic have engaged in work on two fronts: description and analysis
of V1 compounds within Greek, and explanation of the origin of the V1 type in the
parent language. These two fronts are not necessarily separate: rather, the anal-
ysis of the Greek material has often been preparatory to the development of evo-
lutionary theories that encompass other IE languages, and the parent language
itself. Greek has occupied an important position in the debate over the existence
and development of V1 in PIE, as Greek is the ancient IE language in which the
V1 type is most attested and most productive. As a consequence, we now possess
a number of studies of Greek V1 compounds but, at the same time, the dearth of
similarly full descriptions of V1 compounds in other ancient languages makes
delineation of the origin and development of the type in earlier linguistic stages
an arduous task (see also Chapter 4, section 2).
     The approaches chosen for the study of Greek V1 compounds vary greatly. The
bone of contention is the question of whether the φερέοικος and τερψίμβροτος
types, though differing in the shape of their FCs, represent two subtypes of the
same compound category, which express identical semantics and derive from
similar formation processes, or not. Depending on how this preliminary ques-
tion is settled, scholars have either sought to trace the origin of FCs back to the
same PIE category (imperatives, bare stems, etc.) or have refrained from reaching
a unified solution, privileging a synchronic morphological and semantic descrip-
tion. Those aspiring to an explanation in an IE perspective have struggled to fit the
ambiguous evidence provided by the various IE languages into a coherent theory
(for often only one or the other of the two types is attested).1 Aside from the over-
views that attempt to offer comprehensive analyses of types of V1 compounds in
Greek (e.g. Knecht (1946) and Frei-Lüthy (1978), on which see section 9), an abun-
dant harvest of studies focuses on questions concerning the semantics, produc-
tivity, literary usage of V1 compounds or of individual sub-types. Many of these
studies are now classic and will be reviewed in this chapter according to the kind
of approach they use to study V1 compounds.
3 Early nineteenth-century work
Before Clemm’s (1867) volume on Greek V1 compounds, no other works specif-
ically addressed the question of the origin of V1 compounds in the parent lan-
1 See, e.g., Wackernagel (1905: 315–320) and Renou (1940–1941: 217–220) for Sanskrit, Watkins
(1969a: 95) and Duchesne-Guillemin (1936: 198–202) for Iranian, Kammenhuber (1961: 197) for
Anatolian languages, where the type seems to have been lost. See further Chapter 4, section 2.

guage, but V1 compounds were discussed in the context of the theories concern-
ing the development of compounding in PIE. These early works include Jacob
Grimm’s Deutsche Grammatik, in the second volume of which Grimm maintained
that the elements -ε- and -σι- featuring at the end of the FCs of Greek compounds
reflected present imperatives and old future imperatives respectively.2 Grimm was
one of the first advocates of the view that V1 compounds derived from syntactic
phrases containing inflected verbal forms and, consequently, that V1 forms were
to be considered ‘false’ compounds:3
     ist es also nothwendig uneigentliche Composition, so folgt, daß das erste Wort nicht die
     bloße Wurzel, sondern eine leibliche Flexion enthalte.
     Grimm (1826: 984).
An equally syntactic principle underlies Bopp’s subsequent interpretation of FCs
in -σι- as third ps. sg. presents, and Weissenborn’s view that they derive from
second ps. sg. forms.4 The 1860s also saw the first publication of the second
volume of Leo Meyer’s Vergleichende Grammatik der griechischen und lateinischen
Sprachen, dealing with the IE noun. Meyer claimed that in PIE nouns in -ti-
endowed with agentive semantics and purely adjectival in origin were employed
to form both second and first compound constituents; in his view, the Greek type
in -σι- was a development of these original formations in -ti-.5
     Justi (1861), on the other hand, went in a different direction, assuming that
the FC of V1 compounds concealed an old participle: he explained φερέσβιος as
an alteration of *φερέτ-βιος, supposedly showing a participial stem, which he
compared to Sanskrit formations like kṣáyad-vīra- ‘killing men’ (see Chapter 4,
section 4.3.2).6 This was consistent with Justi’s idea that compounding arose in a
phase of PIE which had already developed inflections: as we will see shortly, this
view was soon to be swept away by Georg Curtius’ influential ‘pre-inflectional’
thesis, according to which compounding went back to a phase of PIE in which
there existed only roots.

4 See Bopp (1861: 348), where -σι- is explained as deriving from the athematic conjugation, and
Weissenborn (1865: 12), according to whom compounds in -εσι- and in -σι- contain second ps.
endings, while those in -ε- go back to imperatives. Bopp (1861: 440) interpreted φερε- etc. as
nominal stems in which -ε- is the ‘reduction’ (Schwächung) of the nominal suffix -ο-.

4 Wilhelm Clemm and the stem hypothesis
The two contributions on Greek V1 compounds by Wilhelm Clemm (1867; 1875)
contain a few elements of discontinuity with these early views. The 1867 Habilita-
tionsschrift represents an important step forward in that it gathers together most
of the Greek V1 compounds available at that time, which are analysed vis-à-vis
nominal stems, with the aim of showing that their FCs should not be linked to
nouns but to verbs.
     In rejecting the nominal interpretation Clemm went against the hypotheses
advanced by Bopp (1861: 439–441) and L. Meyer (1865: 328); but he also rejected
the position adopted by Justi (1861: 45), namely that V1 compounds derived from
old participles.7 At the same time, Clemm forcefully excluded Grimm’s idea that
the FCs of V1 compounds could go back to inflected forms:8 rather, he asserted
that the FCs of both Greek V1 types contained simple verbal stems.9 Clemm was
clearly influenced by Georg Curtius, with whom he briefly studied in Leipzig:
Curtius was of the opinion that only stems could be used in ‘true’ compounds
and that the FC of V1 compounds featured verbal stems, sometimes enlarged with
thematic vowels -ε-, -ι- and -ο-.10
     Clemm’s work paved the road for a number of disputes over the interpreta-
tion of V1 compounds, as well as their IE origin. In 1869 Richard Rödiger crit-
ically reviewed Clemm’s book, calling stems as ‘abstractions that only exist in
the minds of linguists’ and, particularly, attacking the idea favoured by Clemm
(and Curtius) that -ε-, -ι-, and -ο- were mere linking vowels attached to verbal
stems.11 After a few years Clemm launched a repartee with his 1875 article in
Curtius Studien, a review of new works in the realm of Greek compounding. The
article frontally addressed the criticism levelled against Clemm by Rödiger as well
as by G. Meyer and reiterated that the FC of the φερέοικος type was a present stem
which could keep or obliterate the thematic vowel:
     Ihre ersten Glieder sind präsentische Verbalstämme mit erhaltenem oder abgeworfenem
     Themavocal; im Formen wie τλή-θυμος [...] war ein solcher nie, in λαθ-ήβης [...] braucht

10 See Curtius (1863: 139, 143) and Curtius (1875: 199) on the use of stems, and the critical over-
view in Lindner (2012: 93); for compounding as a relic of a pre-inflectional stage and Curtius’
interpretation of V1 compounds, see Curtius (1873: 64–71) and Curtius (1875: 201).

sertation on the vocalic element of Greek FCs.

     aufweisen können.
     Clemm (1875: 38).
Clemm also restated that sigmatic compounds contained the stem of the s-aorist
and criticized the view advanced by some of his critics, who claimed that the s-ao-
rist stem ought to have ended in -σα. Clemm countered this view by suggesting
that compounds in -σε- and -σο- represented a ‘reduction’ (Schwächung) of the
original -σα.12 As regards other shapes of FCs, Clemm interpreted those ending
in -α- (e.g., ταλα-) as showing a pure verbal root, relics of a stage in which verbs
were not yet characterized by the thematic vowel. More surprisingly, he also
assumed that FCs ending in -αι- (e.g., ταλαι-) reflected (often unattested) present
stems in -αιω.13
     The element -ι- received a different treatment. Clemm argued that some of
the FCs ending in -ι- derived from present stems formed with the -jé/ó- suffix (e.g.
χαριεργός < *χαρ-jω), while others reflected a reduction (Schwächung) of the the-
matic vowel -ε- (e.g., λαθικηδής).14 In Clemm’s view, however, the larger number
of -σι- compounds simply reflected the ‘preferential relationship’ (Wahlverwan-
dtschaft) between -σ- and -ι-, which nominal FCs in -σι- and abstract nouns in -σις
encouraged.15
     Some of Clemm’s statements may appear pleonastic to us (for instance his
emphasis on the first element of V1 compounds being a verb), but they must be
placed in context. In those years a heated controversy raged over the question of
whether early PIE distinguished between verbs and nouns. With the interpreta-
tion of V1 compounds as containing verbal stems, Clemm was probably reacting
to the view that in the early stages of PIE verbs and nouns had originally been
undifferentiated, and to the corollary that the FCs of V1 compounds could not
contain a verbal stem.16 The details of Clemm’s explanations are often out-dated
now, but the core of his interpretation—that V1 compounds contain stems, not
inflected verbal forms—has stood the test of time and remains a valid and widely
endorsed view (cf. section 8). My analysis will also emphasise the interpretation
of the FCs as verbal roots or stems which, in some cases, may be followed by
linking elements: see Chapter 4, particularly section 6.1.

5 Jacobi, Delbrück and Brugmann: from stems to imperatives
Between the 1850s and the 1880s the analysis of IE and Greek compounding was
extensively influenced by the more general debate surrounding IE morphology.17
Under Curtius’ influence, many of the linguists who addressed V1 compounds
in those years assumed that the FCs of these compounds contained stems and
went back to a pre-inflectional stage of the language.18 Clemm’s works contrib-
uted to spreading these views, but Curtius’ influence is also visible in the early
editions of the most important works of Karl Brugmann, who studied with Curtius
at Leipzig. In the first edition of his Griechische Grammatik (1885), Brugmann
maintained that the Greek compounds derived from verbal stems represented
innovations arising from the re-analysis of older nominal types.19 The same state-
ment is made in the the first edition of Brugmann’s monumental Grundriss der
vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen, where V1 compounds
are not included amongst those of ‘Urindogermanische Zeit’, but are considered
a development of individual languages arising from the misinterpretation of
nominal stems.20 In line with Curtius’ teachings, therefore, Brugmann believed
the FCs of ‘real’ compounds to be ‘stems’: applied to V1 compounds, this led him
to identify their FCs with old nominal stems re-interpreted as verbal elements and
provided with the linking vowel -ε-, or with stems from -σις abstract nouns which
were later associated with the s-aorist.21 Brugmann explained the alternation of
various FCs by pointing to analogical processes affecting the V1 subgroups (for
instance, -εσι- was interpreted as analogical on FCs from s-stem nouns).
     At the same time, however, Brugmann and the linguists of the Neogrammar-
ian circle became increasingly more critical of Curtius’ dogmatism. With regard
to the interpretation of compounds, the Neogrammarians’ attitude may have
prompted a less strict approach to the relationship between compounding and
inflections and a renewed interest in the influence of syntax on compounding.
Thus, while Curtius’ early influence is still perceivable in the first edition of the
Grundriss, it is also clear that Brugmann had already moved away from his teacher
in that he believed the FCs of V1 compounds to be (at least originally) nominal,
not verbal stems. In making this claim, Brugmann was in accord with the views of

Hermann Osthoff, with whom in 1878 he had started editing the journal Morphol-
ogische Untersuchungen, which acted as the sounding-board of the Neogrammar-
ian approach to linguistics. In this same year, Osthoff published his monograph
on verbal compounds programmatically entitled Das Verbum in der Nominalkom-
position im Deutschen, Griechischen, Slavischen und Romanischen.22
     The main points of Osthoff’s work are that the FCs of Greek V1 compounds
cannot be identified with imperatives;23 that the equation with the Modern
German imperatival compounds is wrong;24 that both Greek V1 types originally
contained nominal stems;25 and that the use of verbal stems in Greek is the
outcome of the reanalysis of old nominal stems:
     Wenn Homer Ἀγέ-λαος, ἀρχέ-κακος gebrauchte, so ist nicht unmöglich, dass diesen Bil-
     dungen in der Tat ehemalige *Ἀγό-λαος *ἀρχό-κακος zeitlich voraus lagen; die homer.
     φυγο-πτόλεμος, ̓λιτό-μηνος, ἁμαρτο-επ́ς könnten ja eben die überreste diese früheren
     Schicht sein. In diesen wurden dann die nominalen Anfangsglieder misgedeutet, an die
     Verba ἄγω, ἄρχω angelehnt.
     Osthoff (1878: 164).
Osthoff’s words are echoed in the first edition of Brugmann’s Grundriss:
     Bei manchen Compp. veränderte sich, gleichwie im Germanischen und Slavischen, das
     Sprachgefühl gegenüber dem das erste Glied bildenden Nominalstamme in der Weise, dass
     er verbal empfunden wurde. Diess veranlasste dann zahlreiche Neubildungen, in denen
     nun wirkliche verbale Stammformen als 1. Glied eingesetzt wurden.
     Brugmann (1889: 49).
In the second edition of the Grundriss, however, Brugmann’s enthusiasm for this
explanation seems to have cooled and his approach is radically different. Here
Brugmann clearly identifies the FC of both compound types, as well as of their
parallels in other IE languages, with old imperatives:
     In α) und β) [Greek types ἑλκεχ́των and δαμασ́μβροτος] war das Vorderglied eine Form mit
     imperativischer Funktion, so dass im Prinzip z.B. ἑλκεχ́των auf ἕλκε (τὸν) χιτῶνα ‘schleppe
     den Peplos’ beruhte. Der Typus α) zeigt bei den Verbalstämmen ohne thematischen Vokal
     noch die Imperativformen ohne die Partikel -dhi (ἴ-θι), nach Art von gr. ἔξ-ει, ἵστη, lat. ī,
     cedo. Der Typus β) zeigt Infinitivformen auf -ti mit imperativischer Bedeutung.

140          Chapter Three – The Study of Ancient Greek and Indo-European V1 Compounds
Brugmann had expressed his new view in another contribution on Greek com-
pounding, the article published in Indogermanische Forschungen of the years
1905–1906, in which he clearly identified the FC of ἀρχέκακος with an imperative
and that of ἑλκεσίπεπλος with an infinitive arising from abstract nouns in -ti- and
having imperatival function.26 The radical change in Brugmann’s analysis is mir-
rored in Berthold Delbrück’s views on the syntax of compounds, which Delbrück
put forward in the third volume of his Vergleichende Syntax, published in 1900,
while Brugmann was working on the second edition of the Grundriss.
     This attention to the syntactic patterns behind compounding was inaugu-
rated by another influential work of the 1890s, Jacobi’s Compositum und Neben-
satz (1897).27 Jacobi himself subscribed to Curtius’ view that ‘true’ compounds
employed bare stems, but his ground-breaking methodology resided in linking
the shape and semantics of V1 compounds to verbal phrases. Even though Jacobi
did not directly relate the structure of compounds to word order issues, which
later became the main focus of the syntactic approach to compounding (see
section 7), he attempted to explain PIE syntactic patterns through the structure of
compounds, an approach later developed by Lehmann.28
     On the question of verbal compounds in particular, Jacobi identified the SC
of V2 compounds as ‘relative participles’, the FCs of the φερέοικος type as verbal
stems, and those of the τερψ́μβροτος type as a third person singular.29 At the
same time, he assumed that in PIE, as well as in Greek and Sanskrit, some of
these compounds came to be associated with imperatival clauses and their FCs
with imperatives:
     In einem Compositum wie ἀγέ-λαος ist [...] das erste Glied der Stamm des thematischen
     Präsens bez. Aorists. Da nun dieser Stamm in historischer Zeit als 2. Pers. Sing. Imperativi
     fungirt, so könnte man dergleichen Composita als imperativische Satznamen deuten [...].
     Denn da viele der fraglichen Composita wie einfache beschreibende Adjektive gebraucht
     werden, so verlangt die natürliche Auflösung das Prädikat in der dritten Person [...]. Wenn
     aber das Compositum als Epitheton einer Person oder als Eigenname gebraucht wird, wäre
     eine imperativische Deutung wohl denkbar. [...] Indem sich nun in diesem engeren Kreise
     die imperativische Deutung befestigte, werden Neubildungen entstanden sein, in denen
     nicht nur die ursprünglich berechtigen Formen der 2. Sing. Imp., die mit dem Präsens- oder
26 Brugmann (1905–1906: 60–61, 70–71, 73). The recognition that compound constituents went
back to inflected forms rather than stems echoes Brugmann’s (1906: 6) forceful statement that
‘eine ‘Wurzelperiode’ hat es im Urindogermanischen nie gegeben. Denn von jeher hat man nur
Wörter, Formen gebildet’.

     erstes Compositionsglied verwandt worden sind.
     Jacobi (1897: 73–74).
The opposition to the belief that verbal stems could not be used in compounding
is clear:
     Die gemeine Ansicht nun [...] geht dahin, dass ein Nomen nicht mit einem Verbum in der
     Zusammensetzung verbunden werden könne. Dieser Satz schien aprioristische Geltung zu
     haben: um seine Richtigkeit zu erhärten, brauchte man nur an ein gesundes Sprachgefühl
     zu appelliren. [...] Fast in allen indogerm. Sprachen finden sich nämlich Composita mit ver-
     balem Vordergliede. Man schloss also und musste so bei dem unbestrittenen Grundsatze
     von der Unzusammensetzbarkeit des Verbums mit dem Nomen schliessen, dass jene Com-
     posita nicht in der Ordnung wären, oder mit anderen Worten, dass sie nicht ihre ursprüng-
     liche Gestalt bewahrt hätten.
     Jacobi (1897: 49).
Jacobi’s ideas had an impact on both Delbrück and Brugmann. Although Del-
brück did not agree that the verbal constituent of V2 compounds was a participle
and maintained that it was a noun, he agreed with Jacobi that V1 compound con-
stituents such as μενε- or φερε- contained a verb rather than a noun, and that it
was most probable that these verbal forms were old imperatives.30 Delbrück sup-
ported this hypothesis by noting that in syntactic phrases the imperative often
occupies the first position. Surprising as it might seem, Delbrück preferred not
to comment on the origin of the τερψ́μβροτος type, suspending his judgment.31
     For his part, towards the end of his career Brugmann (who died in 1919) had
fully subscribed to the syntactic interpretation of V1 compounds, which he took
to its extreme consequences by seeking a common function for the FCs of both
the τερψ́μβροτος and the φερέοικος types, a line that neither Jabobi nor Del-
brück had decided to follow in full. Thanks to the influence of Brugmann’s great
Grundriss (still particularly unsurpassed as far as compounding is concerned),
the imperatival hypothesis has had a large following. The same views expressed
in the second edition of the Grundriss recur in the new editions of Brugmann’s
Griechische Grammatik—although in the fourth edition, reworked by Albert
Thumb, the imperatival interpretation of the φερέοικος type is not presented
as the only possible one.32 In more general terms, Delbrück’s and Brugmann’s

the Grammatik: see Schwyzer (1939: 445).

enthusiasm for the syntactic hypothesis may be seen as another Neogrammarian
rejection of the postulation that PIE did not possess full ‘words’ but only roots.33
      Another influential subscriber to the imperatival interpretation was Jacob
Wackernagel. In volume 2.1 of the Altindische Grammatik two of the Sanskrit V1
types (trasá-dasyu- ‘making the enemy tremble’ and dti-vara- ‘giving treasures’)
are interpreted as going back to imperatives.34 In more recent times, the impera-
tival interpretation has been invoked mainly to explain the Greek φερέοικος type
only.35 Dunkel (1992: 216–220) is one of the few scholars who have retained the
imperatival interpretation for the τερψίμβροτος type as well, maintaining that
their FC goes back to an old -si imperative. He also claims that the Vedic type
bharád-vāja- ‘bringing/obtaining prizes’ and the Greek specimen φερε-πτόλεμος
contain old injunctives, a hypothesis which was first advanced (though eventu-
ally rejected) by Renou (1940–1941) and which Watkins (1969a: 94–96) considers
as well.36 According to Dunkel (1992: 200), such injunctive compounds were prob-
ably used ‘to make an extra-temporal statement of eternally valid fact’. Both the
imperatival and the injunctive hypotheses have received criticism: see Schindler
(1997: 539) and section 6 below.
6 Beyond the imperatival hypothesis: other approaches to
6 τερψ́μβροτος compounds
The imperative hypothesis has a clear corollary: the admission that PIE com-
pounding was not exclusively stem compounding. A number of later works paid
increasing attention to the impact of verbal morphology and syntax on V1 com-
pounds. The variety of approaches is most visible in the analysis of τερψ́μβροτος
compounds. A new interpretation put forward at the beginning of the twentieth
century was that their FCs went back to old desiderative stems: see particularly
Meillet (1919), still hinted at in Meillet and Vendryès (1960: 429).37 Another—iso-
lated—view is that which sees in the FC of compounds in -σι- an original verbal
adjective in *-to-, on which see Renel (1896) and Williger (1928: 6 n. 2).

     In contrast, the nominal interpretation of the FC has continued to hold
ground and is still the most popular view on τερψ́μβροτος compounds. We have
already seen that the similarities between Greek FCs in -σι- and action nouns
in -σις, as well as that between Skt. FCs in -ti- and action nouns in -tis, did not
escape early scholars such as L. Meyer and R. Rödiger. The idea that FCs in -σι-
went back to action nouns is found in many works, including Christ (1890: 207),
Bréal (1895–1896), Debrunner (1917: 39) and Knecht (1946: 24–25), and received
further impulse after Jochem Schindler likewise adopted it. Schindler forcefully
rejected the idea that finite verbal forms (either imperatives or third person sin-
gulars or infinitives) could be used as compound FCs.38 For Schindler, the origin
of the Vedic and Greek types lay in old action nouns in -tis, though the assibila-
tion that intervened in Greek led to a re-analysis of the old types as deriving from
sigmatic verbal tenses, and eventually to the uniquely Greek invention of a whole
class of compounds based on the stem of the s-aorist or of the future.39 In Schin-
dler’s view the original compounds had a possessive structure but came to be
interpreted as verbal compounds with a factitive meaning.40 Schindler’s hypoth-
esis is further reviewed in Chapter 4, sections 4.3–4.3.1; an endorsement of his
approach can be found, for instance, in Janda (1999), Vegas Sansalvador (1999),
Lindner (2011: 70).
     Another interpretative trend starts from the assumption that the FC of
τερψ́μβροτος compounds contains a nomen agentis. This possibility, already dis-
cussed by G. Meyer (1872: 110) and Osthoff (1878: 169), was later revived by P. Kret-
schmer and F. Specht, who therefore saw the τερψ́μβροτος type as completely
independent from φερέοικος compounds. Specht (1932) noted that the FCs of -ti-
compounds could not contain action nouns, since the root grade shown by these
FCs is usually full. Instead, he maintained that the FCs of τερψ́μβροτος com-
pounds originally contained the same root nouns as those found in the root com-
pounds of the type ἀ-γνωτ- and προ-βλήτ- (Chapter 2, section 6.1), to which the
linking vowel -i- was added, at the beginning to aid the transition to SCs beginning
with a consonant. On this point his interpretation is ambiguous in that he openly
speaks of ‘roots’ employed in the FC which, however, became nouns through the
use of the element -ti-.41 Kretschmer (1934) accepted this interpretation, though
he noted the intrinsic vagueness of the statement that the FC is a verbal root used

reine Wurzel enthalten, die durch Anfügung von ti genau so als Nomen charakterisiert wurde,
wie am Schluß des Kompositums durch Erweiterung von t’.

144         Chapter Three – The Study of Ancient Greek and Indo-European V1 Compounds
as a noun.42 Kretschmer identified onomastics as the linguistic realm in which
roots enlarged with -t- + -i- began to be employed in the FC of compounds, consid-
ering this just another example of the well-known onomastic tendency to create
reverse compounds. The existence of compounds of the φερέοικος type (which
in Kretschmer’s opinion are imperatival) further supported the creation of a new
type of compounds with a verbal FC.43
      The Specht-Kretschmer hypothesis is important in that it looks at a core of
root compounds in order to explain the -ti- element in the FCs of V1 compounds.
At the same time, other aspects of the hypothesis are open to criticism. The
claims that the V1 type was already on the way to extinction in the fifth century
BC (Specht 1932: 32) and that it was used as a mere stylistic device (Specht 1932:
35) are confuted both by the data collected in this book and by the productivity
of the V1 type in onomastics. More importantly, the undeniable similarity of FCs
in -ti- with root compounds leads Specht and Kretschmer to conclude that these
FCs contain nouns, an idea which other linguists have developed to the point of
speaking overtly of ‘agent nouns’.44 This hypothesis opens a fundamental ques-
tion as concerns the structure of these V1 compounds, since they would be the
only example of reversed agentive compounds in the whole of Indo-European.
Linguists who concern themselves with this issue often have to find an ad hoc
solution by positing that such an inversion originated within onomastics, i.e. in a
linguistic domain which is supposed to be freer as far as morphological patterns
are concerned. In Chapter 4 we will return to this issue with an eye to the Sanskrit
evidence for compounds in -ti-.
7 The syntactic hypothesis and other work on V1 compounds
7 and IE word order
As mentioned, some early works such as Grimm’s Deutsche Grammatik inter-
preted V1 compounds as deriving from syntactic phrases. In the following years
several contributions linked V1 compounds to inflected verbal forms: as noted,
Weissenborn (1865) championed the present second person singular, whereas
42 Kretschmer (1934: 250).
43 Kretschmer (1934: 250), Kretschmer (1936: 244).
44 Bader’s position on -ti- has often changed over time. In Bader (1970: 54) she overtly speaks
of a nomen agentis employed in the FC, while in Bader (1974: 46) she describes these FCs as roots
enlarged with the -ti- element. Reviewing the whole debate Stefanelli (2008: 22) adopts a purely
synchronic perspective and analyses Greek compounds in -τι- as an inversion of compounded
nomina agentis in -τᾱ-. This would place the origin of -τι- compounds within Greek, inasmuch as
agent nouns in -τᾱ- are a Greek innovation.

                       7 The syntactic hypothesis and other work on V1 compounds             145
Theodor Bergk claimed that Greek PNs in -σι- originally contained the present
third person singular.45 Outside Germany, early intuitions on the correlation of
compound structure and word order feature in Bergaigne (1875–1878), who par-
ticularly insisted that compounds should be used to infer information about word
order in the parent language.46
     The trend was taken up and given full theoretical shape by Jacobi. As men-
tioned, his views that V1 compounds had their origin in syntactic verbal phrases
won the favour of Delbrück, Brugmann, and later also Hirt (1928: 34–35), who
admitted that V1 compounds might have been formed both with verbal stems and
inflected verbal forms. Apart from these early espousals, however, Jacobi’s syn-
tactic interpretation met with considerable criticism, still echoed half a century
later in Leonard Bloomfield’s words:
     Bopp took for granted that the formative elements of Indo-European were once independent
     words; this is a needless and unwarranted assumption. The last descendant of his error is
     the assumption that IE compound words are historically derived from phrases (Jacobi, Com-
     positum und Nebensatz [...]; this even in Brugmann Grundriss II2, 1, pp. 37, 78).
     Bloomfield (1926: 153 n. 3).47
A whole school of thought has developed from these early intuitions, which has
left aside the issue of whether the FCs of V1 compounds are to be identified with
infinitives, imperatives or third persons singular, and has focused on syntactic
patterns and word order instead (see Chapter 2, section 7.5.4). The question at
the core of such syntactic approaches is the same as that underlying the present
study: why do Greek and other IE languages have compound types that are the
structural mirror image of one another? In the emphasis accorded to morphologi-
cal investigation by most nineteenth-century comparative linguistics studies, the
issue had been largely ignored.
     Early work on the investigation of Greek compound orientation was under-
taken by Bechtel and Fick (1894) and later by Andriotis (1938). These two contri-
butions, though different in scope, enquire into the mechanisms behind struc-
tural alternations in Greek compounds. Bechtel and Fick (1894) deal with the
frequent inversion of members in compounded PNs in the context of a vast inves-
tigation of Greek onomastics, while the article by Andriotis (1938) is specifically
interested in compound structure. Its most interesting claims are discussed in
Chapter 2, section 7.5.4, apropos of the orientation of Greek compounds. Com-
pared to Bechtel and Fick, Andriotis adopts a strikingly different approach in that

he rejects the idea that V1 compounds are specialized as an onomastic type and
that their structure is dependent on the tendency to freely create reversed PNs. At
the same time, however, Andriotis does not identify clear mechanisms ruling the
interaction of V1 and V2 compounds; his suggestions thus differ from other syn-
tactic analyses, which bring word order into the picture. Both contributions reach
similar conclusions: the alternation has no linguistic motivation, but springs
from the creative character of the Greek language and of the Greeks themselves.48
We will see in Chapters 5 and 6, however, that specific morphological issues may
govern the creation of V1 compounds.
     The issue was taken up again by Émile Benveniste in an influential 1967
article, programmatically entitled ‘Fondements syntaxiques de la composition
nominale’. Its claims have been addressed in Chapter 2, section 7.5.4, but it is
worth re-considering this study here as a chapter in the development of syntactic
analyses of V1 compounds. In line with early French contributions on this topic,49
Benveniste’s article considers both the syntactic interface and the semantic
nuances of alternating pairs, placing particular emphasis on the V1/V2 alterna-
tion. In Benveniste’s interpretation, while the V2 type expresses a generic verbal
action, a ‘présent intemporel de définition’, the V1 type indicates a specific verbal
action, the ‘realité du process’: accordingly οἰκοφόρος (an adjective) identifies
a ‘porteur par vocation ou nature’, while φερέοικος (the snail) is someone ‘qui
porte effectivement’.50 However, Benveniste does not clarify what the origin of
the V1 type would be.51
     A turning point is represented by W. P. Lehmann’s article ‘Proto-Indo-Euro-
pean Compounds in Relation to Other Proto-Indo-European Syntactic Patterns’
(1969), which was the first work to rethink the issue of compound orientation in
an updated IE syntactic perspective. As Lehmann points out, while Indo-Euro-
peanists of the generation before his own devoted little attention to how the PIE
sentence was arranged, recent investigation into PIE syntactic patterns has led to
recognition that compound structure is not autonomous of word order: the most
common types (e.g. V2 compounds) correspond to the type of word order that
independent research has recognized as being the standard arrangement in PIE.52

wusstes, heiteres Spiel des griechischen Volksgeistes’ (repeated in Bechtel (1917: xiii)); and

                        7 The syntactic hypothesis and other work on V1 compounds             147
The most important point of Lehmann’s article is the hypothesis that V1 com-
pounds are verb-initial not because they contain old imperatives (which do tend
to occupy the first position in a sentence) but because they reflect PIE marked
word order:
     The derivation from imperatives [...] apparently is based on the preference for initial posi-
     tion of the verb in the PIE imperative sentence. But [...] one type of PIE clause, the clause
     with marked order, is characterized by initial position of the verb. In view of the use of
     verb-noun synthetic compounds for names and other stylistically marked compounds, it is
     far more credible to relate these synthetics with the marked sentence order.
     Lehmann (1969: 13).
The hypothesis that V1 compounds reflect the PIE marked word order while V2
compounds reflect the unmarked word order is now widely accepted: see, e.g.,
Tischler (1979: 864–866), Uhlich (1993: 93–95), and Uhlich (1997: 25 n. 13). The
syntactic approach has the merit of having provided another point of view on
issues of structure and orientation in IE compounding. Its most important legacy
is the recognition—already adumbrated in nineteenth-century works, but now
given a full theoretical basis—that it is not possible to treat compounds as being
wholly independent of syntax and of the word order and sentence patterns avail-
able in a language. The adoption of syntactic analysis in an IE perspective is ben-
eficial in that it allows an explanation of seemingly odd compound structures
that go against the general trend manifested by a language, as such structures
can be considered in the light of an older syntactic pattern. More importantly, the
syntactic approach is the only one that has so far proposed a reasonable explana-
tion of why in PIE some compounds were verb-initial even though the verb-final
pattern was available and seemingly more productive.
     At the same time, however, the shortcomings of many syntactic analyses
must not be overlooked.53 One such shortcoming is the tendency—evident in all
standard works of this kind—to consider PIE word order almost as the sole reason
why V1 compounds in the individual IE languages are verb-initial. Clearly, any
syntactic approach must always take into account that an inherited compound
structure may be altered within an individual language to accommodate the
special morpho-syntactic rules of that language—with the result that the individ-
ual IE languages may in fact contain compound types that are not representative
53 The interface between syntax and compounding is a widely debated topic in the literature on
compounding, as can be seen in many of the contributions in Lieber and Štekauer (2009a); see in
particular Fradin (2009: 422–428) and Kornfeld (2009: 444–452), on syntax and V1 compounds
in French and Spanish respectively. For AG, see Bader (2005). See also Chapter 1, section 6.2 and
Chapter 2, section 7.5.4.

of PIE syntactic patterns and vice versa. Another shortcoming of contributions
focusing on the discovery of syntactic patterns is that they often completely avoid
addressing the morphological analysis of compounds. Once it is agreed that the
V1 structure reflects an inherited marked word order, the question of what the FC
originally represented still remains. There is a remarkable tendency to brush off
this fundamental question in some of the syntactic work of the last fifty years.54
In the analysis of V1 compounds provided in the next chapter, we will propose
that V1 compounds are based on simple verbal roots or stems and that their ori-
entation is influenced by marked word order: they are not secondary inversions
of V2 types.
7.1 Further syntactic approaches
In more recent years the investigation of the PIE syntactic patterns underly-
ing compounds has spun a whole series of works dealing with the discovery of
phrases which might have provided the basis for the creation of individual com-
pounds. This represents a specialization of more extensive work carried out on
the description of IE word order, poetic language, and its formulae and recurring
images.55
      Within the realm of V1 compounds, etymological and syntactic investigations
have chiefly focused on the explanation of V1 PNs in the light of IE poetic lan-
guage and phraseology. Recent contributions in this direction have been offered
particularly by García Ramón (2000a; 2000–2001; 2005a; 2005b; 2006a; 2006b;
2008; 2009; 2011) and also by Dubois (2000; 2001; 2006). For an introduction to
this approach and some of its results, see Chapter 6, section 6.3, as well as the
interpretation of the Mycenaean PNs in Chapter 4, sections 7.1–7.9.
8 The stem hypothesis reconsidered: recent approaches
In recent years the hypothesis that V1 compounds contain simple verbal stems
or roots has been re-assessed. We have seen that in the nineteenth century the
54 A clear morphological definition of the FC is missing in Benveniste (1967), Lehmann (1969),
as well as Uhlich (1993: 96): ‘Verbalwurzel oder Verbalnomen’ (dealing with Old Irish). Schulze
(1979: 806) acknowledges that the connection with the imperative is secondary, without offering
a full explanation of what the FC of φερέοικος is.

frenzy to explain the FCs as inflected verbal forms partly stemmed from the wish
to rebel against the dogmatism of the older generation of Indo-Europeanists who
taught that real PIE compounds could only contain pure roots. Scholars nowa-
days do not find the idea that inflected forms could have been used in compounds
of authentic IE age outrageous and assume that in the long life of the parent
language there might have been different stages which produced different com-
pound patterns.56 The problem therefore does not concern whether fully inflected
verbal forms could be used as compound constituents, but the identification of
which verbal forms would have originated these constituents. If present imper-
atives ending in -e are a possibility for φερέοικος compounds, the interpretation
of τερψίμβροτος and related forms as continuing an old -ti infinitive—or indeed
some kind of modified second or third person present singular—has nowadays
been forsaken.57
      As a result, the hypothesis that the FCs of τερψίμβροτος compounds go
back to old action or agent nouns remains more fashionable, though it brings
the disadvantage that the φερέοικος and τερψίμβροτος types must be dealt with
as two originally different structures in PIE (φερέοικος with an inflected FC,
τερψίμβροτος with a nominal FC). In other words, if we are happy to go down this
road we end up with a description of PIE compounding as having one fully devel-
oped verbal type (with imperatival FCs ending in -e) and a nominal type (with FCs
representing -ti- abstract nouns): the structure of the latter would be strikingly in
contrast with the structure and preferred orientation of IE compounding (see also
Chapter 4, section 4.3.1).
      As a consequence of these shortcomings, many scholars have continued
to defend the stem hypothesis for both compound types. Classic works such as
Tserepis (1902), Sommer (1937: 187–189), Schwyzer (1939: 441), Meillet and Vend-
ryès (1960: 428), as well as Schulze (1979: 806), have all gone back to Clemm’s
explanation of FCs as verbal stems, in some cases explaining the imperatival con-
nection as a later semantic development. There are two obvious advantages in
the stem hypothesis. The first is that it is the only interpretation which makes it
possible to see both FCs characterized by -e- and those characterized by -ti- and
-si- as deriving from the same structural pattern. The second advantage is that it is
a relatively economical interpretation: we do not need to posit unattested verbal
forms or semantic developments to account for it. Moreover, it is a hypothesis
that finds independent support in the way V1 compounds attested in modern IE
languages are often interpreted.58

     In consideration of these advantages, and in the light of the morphological
analysis of the earliest V1 compounds attested in Greek and Vedic provided in
Chapter 4, my own analysis of Greek V1 compounds assumes that the V1 pattern
is of PIE age, and that its FCs originally contained simple verbal roots or stems,
which may sometimes be followed by linking elements. This is argued in detail in
Chapter 4, sections 6–6.1.
9 Two twentieth-century works on Greek V1 compounds
To date, the most recent monographs on Greek V1 compounds are Knecht (1946)
on τερψίμβροτος compounds and Frei-Lüthy (1978), mostly on φερέοικος com-
pounds. Both works assemble a considerable portion of the documentation
available (PNs included), though they do not go beyond the fifth century BC
and refrain from applying an organic methodology to take both categories into
account. However, some of the conclusions these works reach are still relevant,
in particular the emphasis both scholars accord to onomastics and the role of the
latter in the development of the V1 type.
9.1 Theodor Knecht’s Geschichte der griechischen Komposita vom
0.1 Typ τερψίμβροτος
Theodor Knecht’s 1946 Geschichte der griechischen Komposita vom Typ
τερψίμβροτος programmatically sets out to overcome the shortcomings of
earlier works, particularly the theoretical, almost ‘mathematical’ treatment of
the question, which neglected investigation of the productivity, meaning and
relation of individual τερψίμβροτος compounds with each other. Knecht’s
aim is to study the Homeric material in relation to more recent compounds in
order to determine which compounds go back to a PIE age and which are Greek
innovations. For the investigation, he claims to have produced a full corpus of
all the τερψίμβροτος compounds attested in authors up to Aristotle, together
with a selection of later compounds up to Nonnus, and a few onomastic com-
pounds selected from Homer, Hesiod, and inscriptions down to the end of the
sixth century BC.59 Yet, in spite of the book’s stated programme and title, the
collected corpus is often deficient, and the perspective adopted is rarely chron-
ological, both in the sense that a historical treatment of τερψίμβροτος com-

pounds is lacking and also because the announced ‘Geschichte’ in fact halts on
the threshold of the fifth century BC.
     Rather than in the full productivity of the type, Knecht’s main interest lies
in explaining the origin of the FC and identifying which Greek compounds are
inherited from PIE. The initial part of the book is devoted to a description of the
issue: τερψίμβροτος compounds can be connected to either the s-aorist or -tis
abstract nouns, but neither explanation is problem-free.60 The aoristic interpre-
tation meets with three problems. First, Greek has -σι- compounds which do not
correspond to a sigmatic aorist (e.g. ταμεσίχρως vs. ταμεῖν). Second, it is difficult
to explain the linking vowel -ι- within the aorist paradigm. Third, in this interpre-
tative framework the forms in -τι- would remain obscure.
     Although the other hypothesis—that the FC goes back to abstract nouns in
-tis—is problematic in view of the early compounds in which the FC has a root in
the full grade, Knecht eventually accepts it as the most plausible. He overcomes
the problem that the root featured in the FC is usually full (whereas zero grade
is expected in -tis nouns) by noting that in Greek a number of relatively old -σις
nouns are formed from the full grade and that such full-grade forms at times
replace zero-grade forms. He concludes that ‘der Vollständigkeit halber muss
auch für den Rest der ältesten T[erpsimbrotos]K[omposita] die Möglichkeit
eines ti-Abstractums untersucht sein, soweit ein solches nicht bezeugt ist’.61
He consequently proposes to reconstruct a number of such unattested abstract
nouns.
     Knecht therefore submits that the FC of -τι- compounds was in origin an
action noun which, in PNs, was—according to his version of the developments—
re-interpreted in the role of an agent noun (type μάντις). Greek, however, did not
have a large number of such agent nouns in -tis that could support this seman-
tic re-analysis. As a consequence, the type would have died out, if the assibi-
lation of [ti] into [si] in FCs placed before SCs beginning with a vowel had not
intervened to alter the situation. This sound change eventually made the FCs of
τερψίμβροτος compounds resemble aorists and futures; as a result, the deriva-
tion of new compounds from aoristic stems became a productive process. A few
forms in -τι-, however, were preserved either because the phonetic conditions
leading to the assibilation did not arise (that is, when -τι- is preceded by -σ-);
or because a secondary connection with a -σις nominal was not possible.62 The
oscillation between -τι- and -σι- forms was typical of a first chronological stage

152        Chapter Three – The Study of Ancient Greek and Indo-European V1 Compounds
characterized by a degree of uncertainty. This was overcome by a second stage, in
which all original forms in -τι- automatically changed into -σι-.
     Knecht’s working approach is to start from the compounds he considers the
oldest in Homer and the most representative of compounding in the parent lan-
guage. He identifies these as consisting of a group of forms shared by both the
appellative and the onomastic domains, from which newer forms were likely to
have been derived largely through analogical processes. For instance, Knecht con-
siders ῥηξήνωρ ‘breaking armed ranks’ (lit. ‘breaking men, destroying enemies’)
to be an old form: this compound is then argued to have triggered the creation of
φθεισήνωρ ‘destroying men’, employing a different FC. In turn, φθεισήνωρ gave
rise to φθεισίμβροτος ‘destroying mortals’, this to τερψίμβροτος and the latter to
φαεσίμβροτος ‘bringing light to mortals’, which are both epithets classifying the
sun and light in general.63
     While it is true, in general terms, that analogical processes may lead to the
creation of new compounds in the poetic language, Knecht’s proposed chain
of developments appears too mechanical. In particular, the methodological
assumption that old forms only reside in those groups which are shared by both
the appellative and onomastic lexicons (‘ῥηξήνωρ scheint alt zu sein, da es als
Appellativ wie als PN Verwendung findet’) now appears weak: many of Knecht’s
supposedly ‘old’ groups, for instance, are never found in Mycenaean.64 Although
the Mycenaean evidence is certainly very special in that it is transmitted uniquely
by bureaucratic texts, the fact that certain FCs are not found in the LB tablets
must be taken into account when one attempts to create a ‘list’ of old Greek FCs.
     Knecht’s tendency to explain appellatives as back-formations based on exist-
ing PNs also is problematic. An example is his treatment of πλήξιππος which
‘geht unmittelbar auf den PN Λύσιππος zurück’. However, as Knecht himself
acknowledges, Λύσιππος is attested much later than πλήξιππος. Two objections
are in order. The first is of principle. Although a degree of exchange between PNs
and appellatives is to be expected in compounds, the assumption which posits
an almost mechanical priority of PNs over appellatives goes against the (rather
obvious) discrepant fact that PNs, and particularly those of Greek, often reflect
the appellative lexicon (see Chapter 2, section 8). The second objection is that in
this way the role of poetic creativity is diminished: poets would not be able to form
new compounds according to a general morphological pattern, but would need—
as it were—the leading model of the onomastic lexicon. On a more general level,
it should be noted that Knecht’s assumptions are not founded on any in-depth
63 Knecht (1946: 7–9).
64 Compare the list in Knecht (1946: 21) with those in Chapter 4, tables 4.2 and 4.3: only three
FCs have parallels in Mycenaean.

discussion of the role of onomastics in the development of the τερψίμβροτος type
and in Greek compounding in general (compare on the other hand Frei-Lüthy’s
approach to the issue in the next section).
     In spite of its criticisable methodology, however, Knecht’s monograph makes
some important claims. Knecht is the first scholar to systematically draw atten-
tion to the fact that PNs constitute the largest part of τερψίμβροτος compounds in
Homer and that onomastics must be taken into full account for the investigation
of this compound type. More importantly, his observation that already in Homer
τερψίμβροτος compounds may result from different derivational patterns (from
sigmatic aorists, -σις nominals, present stems, thematic aorists, etc.), leads him
to criticize his predecessors’ almost unchallenged dogma that in Greek the type
represents a crystallized relic; he then shows, instead, that τερψίμβροτος com-
pounds are a relatively productive class of compounds which expanded accord-
ing to a criterion of semantic analogy. To some extent, this description of the pro-
ductivity of τερψίμβροτος compounds is correct, although the assumption that
the link with the s-aorist is only a secondary development must, in my view, be
reviewed (see Chapter 4, section 6).
9.2 Frei-Lüthy (1978) and the influence of onomastics
Christine Frei-Lüthy’s study of Greek V1 compounds is part of a monograph (orig-
inally a Magisterarbeit supervised by Ernst Risch) that explores the influence
of onomastics on the Greek appellative lexicon and word formation patterns.
Frei-Lüthy’s field of investigation is restricted to Greek, and as a consequence
she does not offer any new insights into understanding the origin of the V1 type
in PIE.65 On the question of τερψίμβροτος compounds, Frei-Lüthy’s conclusion
entirely follows Knecht’s in arguing that this type had its origin in onomastics.
Her treatment of the category is succinct, but an advancement on Knecht is the
recognition that the τερψίμβροτος type remained productive not only in poetry,
but also in scientific language.66
     Within the framework of the book the investigation of φερέοικος compounds
has a more prominent role. Their origin is clearly identified as having arisen from
imperatives, on the grounds that the primary function of the category was that of
providing names to express a wish for the new-born baby.67 Further developments
presumably triggered the semantic equation of the FC with a nomen agentis or a

participle (an evolution also postulated by Knecht for τερψίμβροτος compounds,
as we have seen). According to Frei-Lüthy, precisely such a reconfiguration of the
FC represents the first step towards the exportation of the φερέοικος type into the
appellative lexicon.68 Frei-Lüthy supports this analysis by noting that φερέοικος
compounds are only attested as PNs in Mycenaean, while Homer already has a
whole group of appellatives. This in turn prompts the question of whether the
transfer to the appellative lexicon must be supposed to have taken place during
the ‘Dark Ages’ or rather within Homeric Greek itself.69 Frei-Lüthy’s conclusion
is that the expansion of the φερέοικος type in the appellative lexicon took place
within the epic language—as a result of the use of compounded PNs as epithets.70
     Frei-Lüthy’s ‘onomastic hypothesis’ calls for two observations. The first is
that her whole theory is based on an argumentum e silentio, namely the fact that
there are no appellative V1 compounds attested in Mycenaean. This, however,
is a weak argument: the evidence of the tablets is too limited to allow bold con-
clusions (one might note that while there are no first person plural verbal forms
attested in Mycenaean, this does not mean that the Mycenaeans did not use verbs
in the first person plural).71 While the high-style flavour of V1 compounds cannot
be denied, one cannot be certain that the appellative use post-dates Mycenaean:
in all probability, if we had a different type of textual evidence we would find V1
compounds used in poetry and other linguistic registers in Mycenaean as well.
The suggested chronological precedence of PNs over appellatives is therefore
purely speculative.
     The second observation concerns the interaction between onomastics and
poetic epithets. Frei-Lüthy’s remark that V1 compounds are particularly special-
ized as PNs and epithets is correct; but whether this means that the V1 type spe-
cifically originated to cover the particular needs of onomastics is open to doubt:
the evidence in support of this suggestion is not clear-cut and, moreover, what
we know about Greek onomastics makes the opposite phenomenon—the influ-
ence of the appellative lexicon on onomastics—much more likely (see Chapter2,
section 8). We will now address some of these issues in greater depth.

9.3 On the onomastic origin of V1 compounds: a critique
The case for the hypothesis that in PIE the V1 type exclusively developed within
onomastics rests on three observations. Firstly, that the oldest Greek forms are all
PNs; secondly, that V1 compounds are frequent in Greek onomastics; thirdly, that
within the appellative lexicon there is a tendency to use them as epithets (i.e. as
quasi-names).
     Of these three observations, the first is not useful: as noted above, the Myce-
naean LB tablets are heavily biased towards the recording of PNs in any case.
The second observation, that V1 compounds are common in Greek onomastics,
in itself does not mean that the V1 type must have originated within onomastics.
Bahuvrihis are similarly very common among PNs, though this does not induce
linguists to search for their origin within PIE onomastics. The productivity of a
given compound structure within Greek onomastics provides information on the
mechanisms ruling name-giving in Greek, not on the origin and specialization of
PIE word formation patterns.
     Finally the third observation—that early V1 compounds are often used as epi-
thets—must be viewed in the light of the available evidence. The first Greek liter-
ary works consist exclusively of epic poetry and it is not surprising that V1 com-
pounds, like other adjectival compounds, are mostly used to characterize heroes,
deities and elements that are at the centre of these narratives. If anything, these
attestations prove the high-style flavour of V1 compounds, not their origin in the
onomastic lexicon. This can be further supported by two independent types of
evidence. The first is the fact that as soon as there are prose texts of sufficient
length, V1 compounds begin to appear outside the poetic lexicon, which means
either that by the time these prose works were written, the V1 type had ceased to
be specialized for PNs and epithets; or (more probably) that it had never fulfilled
that function. The second piece of evidence is provided by a random test: the
distribution of another category of adjectival compounds, bahuvrihis, vis-à-vis
the distribution of V1 compounds in Il. 1–500. In these five-hundred lines there
are thirty-eight bahuvrihis and four V1s. Of the bahuvrihis, twenty-eight are used
as epithets of heroes, gods, and objects, leaving only ten to be used as common
adjectives. Obviously, though, this distribution neither leads us to suppose that
the primary function of bahuvrihis was only that of providing epithets, nor that
bahuvrihis originated as PNs (as already noted).
     These considerations call into question the view, defended by both Knecht
(1946) and Frei-Lüthy (1978), that the V1 type specifically developed in the context
of IE name-giving. The interpretation of the verbal FC as having an imperatival or
augural meaning certainly contributed to the popularity of this compound type

within onomastics, but we simply do not know enough about the parent language
to conclude that the type originated for the specific purpose of forming PNs.
10 Conclusion
The investigation of the AG evidence has played a central role in the develop-
ment of theories concerning IE compounding and the origin of V1 compounds
in PIE. Early works focused on the interpretation of the FC as an inflected verbal
form and often proposed that V1 compounds derived from phrases (Grimm,
Bopp: this was the germ of the later syntactic approach), but a view of this
kind was usually stigmatized in the nineteenth century, when the prevailing
tendency was to interpret the FC of V1 compounds (particularly those in -ti-)
as nominal or verbal stems. This emphasis on the morphological analysis of
the FC is tuned down in later, mostly twentieth-century approaches: scholars
such as Bechtel, Andriotis, Benveniste, Lehmann, Dunkel and García Ramón
have made substantial contributions towards an understanding of the relation-
ship between word order and compounding, but have usually refrained from
explaining what V1 compounds exactly are (an exception being the contribu-
tions by Dunkel and García Ramón).
     The initial criticism levelled against W. Clemm’s stem hypothesis —namely
that bare stems ‘only exist in the mind of linguists’ (R. Rödiger)—has continued to
be directed against the advocates of the stem theory to this very day, particularly
because in Romance the FCs of V1 compounds are synchronically interpretable as
imperative or indicative forms: thus, the idea that they go back to univerbations
of inflected forms rather than displaying bare stems remains very popular, par-
ticularly for the interpretation of φερέοικος compounds.72
     However, as noted in section 10, the stem hypothesis is now widely accepted
even for the interpretation of V1 compounds in modern IE languages. As far as
AG is concerned, it brings the advantage that all V1 types can be interpreted as
subclasses of the same macro-category, which are therefore characterized by the
same structure: the FC is a verbal stem or a root which may be enlarged by linking

see Rainer and Varela (1992), Villalva (1992: 212) and Penny (2002: 300); for Italian, see Zauner
(1905: 81–82). The theories of these scholars are reviewed by Nielsen Whitehead (2012: 165–192),
who subscribes to the interpretation of the FC of Romance V1 compounds as stems, at least proto-
typically. The role of Classical and Late Latin on these Romance compounds is briefly reviewed in
the next chapter. The imperatival hypothesis is also adopted for Slavic compounds by Progovac
(2010) and Progovac (2012).

ment. In the next chapter this explanation of V1 compounds will be reviewed
from a novel point of view, starting from a thorough analysis of early Greek V1
compounds and their comparative background. In particular, we will investigate
how Greek V1 compounds could represent the relics of an older system in which
the different types of FCs reflect the original opposition between present and
aoristic formations that was typical of the PIE verbal system.

Chapter Four –
The Historical Perspective: PIE Background and
Development of V1 Compounds in Early Greek
1 Introduction
This chapter addresses some of the questions which have been central in the
studies of V1 compounds discussed in Chapter 3 and offers a fresh analysis of
the PIE origin of this compound type and of its development in early Greek. The
preliminary question from which the chapter starts concerns whether or not the
V1 type can be reconstructed for the parent language as a whole. Evidence from
the individual ancient IE languages is uneven: the V1 type is fully productive
only in Greek, thus opening the question of whether the few V1 forms attested
in other ancient languages are relics of a lost type, or innovations which arose
independently. Section 2 introduces the issues concerning the comparison of the
Greek and Indo-Iranian material, which is the necessary premise for the recon-
struction of the V1 class as a formation of PIE age. Sections 3 and 4 look at the
morphological properties of V1 compounds in Greek, with close focus on their
FCs and the correlation of these with verbal roots and stems.
     This analysis in turns leads to the pivotal question of whether the two Greek
types of τερψ́μβροτος and φερέοικος compounds represent subsets of the same
compound category or whether they are to be distinguished from one another
and accounted for in different terms. The τερψ́μβροτος type (section 4) is central
to this question, since it is disputed whether its FC is a verbal stem or an action
noun (the hypothesis that it is an inflected verbal form is now regarded to be less
likely). For an appraisal of this issue, section 4.3.2 analyses the Vedic compounds
in -ti-, which have often been used in support of the action noun hypothesis. On
the basis of work carried out by other scholars, this section argues that the avail-
able Vedic compounds in -ti-, though probably continuing an inherited pattern,
have merged with the class of bahuvrihis.
     Section 5 then turns to the Mycenaean evidence in order to test the action
noun hypothesis against the available material. Section 5.1 highlights how the
Mycenaean FCs in -ti- mostly contain bare full-grade roots, whose primary forma-
tion was the root aorist: this section advances the hypothesis that -ti- is neither
a nominal suffix nor the remains of a verbal ending, but a mere linking element
which was developed to ‘block’ the bare root of these FCs and was later identi-
fied as a marker of these formations. In order to better assess the morphological
mechanisms at play in the derivation of FCs from bare verbal roots or stems (from

160          Chapter Four – The Historical Perspective
the present or the aorist), section 6 briefly looks at the broader picture, present-
ing a short introduction to the most widespread theories on the development of
the present and aorist formations in the PIE verbal system. This information is
also useful to assess the role of compounds based on the s-aorist since in the PIE
verbal system the s-aorist arose as an innovation endowed with definite gram-
matical functions.
      Section 7 re-analyzes the Mycenaean compounds with FCs in -ti- starting from
this premise. This section suggests that Mycenaean represents a ‘transitional
stage’ in which the inherited -ti- type begins to be superseded and replaced by
the new -si- type. Sections 7.1–7.8 deal with each of the Mycenaean V1 compounds
in -ti-, with the aim of detecting the morphological or phonological factors which
may have prevented their transformation into -si- compounds. The extent to
which the hypothesis that -ti- compounds merely contain bare verbal roots affects
our understanding of early Greek V1 compounds is discussed in section 7.9.
      Section 8 then looks at how the V1 categories evolved in early alphabetic
Greek. Now largely obscured and superseded by the new derivational pattern in
which the s-aorist attained a primary role, the old compounds in -ti- were mostly
replaced by forms in -si-; their partial preservation is due to specific reasons,
ranging from conservatism to semantic opacity (sections 8.1–8.6). In alphabetic
Greek, V1 compounds thus ended up forming a two-fold system founded on the
opposition of types containing or lacking the -σι- marker. The concurrence of
various analogical processes (in which -σις nominals played an important role)
decreed the steady success of the τερψ́μβροτος type over φερέοικος compounds.
2 V1 compounds in Indo-European
Before considering the question of the origin of V1 compounds in PIE, it is nec-
essary to recall a few facts concerning their existence and productivity in the
IE family. Compounds showing a left-oriented [V N] structure are common in a
large number of languages of the world.1 Not all of these compounds however
are exocentric like those found in Greek. In Mandarin Chinese, for instance, [V N]V
structures such as tóuzī [put money] ‘invest’ are endocentric and the verbal FC
is the head.2 In modern IE languages, exocentric V1 compounds are common in
Romance, where they are productive for the derivation of animate agent nouns
1 Right-oriented [V N] compounds are much more widespread: in these, the SC is the head
(e.g. Germ. Schlafsack [sleep sack] ‘sleeping bag’, bakeshop).
2 See Ceccagno and Basciano (2009: 480), and Kageyama (2009: 514) for Chinese borrowings
into Japanese. A comparable type is attested in Mapudungun: Baker and Fasola (2009: 595).

(e.g. Fr. porteparole [carry word] ‘spokesperson’) or instrument nouns (e.g. Sp.
abre-latas [open cans] ‘can-opener’), and are also common in surnames and
nick-names (e.g. It. Tagliaferro [cut iron]). All these types are semantic specializa-
tions of the agent noun function, which has also produced several plant names
in early Romance.3
     The high number of such V1 forms in Romance has duly been noted by schol-
ars. Studies have mostly revolved around two areas, which are very similar to
those debated in Greek linguistics: the morphological analysis of the FC (and
hence the processes at the origin of these V1 compounds) and the relation of
the Romance formations to those attested in other IE languages, particularly as
concerns their historical development.4 This is not the place to dwell on a full
account of the trends in the interpretation of Romance V1 compounds, but it may
be useful to note that the debate over whether the FC is a stem or an inflected
imperative is central in these studies.5
     In order to evaluate the peculiarities of Romance V1 compounds, it is useful
to take a quick look at the V1 compounds attested in other IE languages. As far as
Celtic is concerned, there are no V1 forms among the compounded PNs studied
by Uhlich (1993), while the V1 compounds attested in Breton seem to have been
borrowed from French (Pilch 1996). In German, English, Baltic and Slavic V1 com-
pounds are restricted and betray an onomastic origin: consider Germ. Bacbrot
[bake bread] ‘baker’ (a surname), Engl. pick-pocket (arguably deriving from a a
nick-name), Lithuanian Vytautas [drive people] ‘leader of the people’ (a name),
Old Church Slavonic Vladislav [rule Slavs] ‘ruler of the Slavs’ (a name), Serbian
cepi-dlaka [split hair] ‘hair-splitter’ (an insult).6 In Germanic, the most proba-
ble explanation of this distribution is that these forms were developed through
contact with Romance, which led to the adoption of the V1 type in some varie-
ties.7 If any earlier influence has to be posited, it must be attributed to Late
Antiquity and hence to Late Latin influence: Nielsen Whitehead overtly argues
3 See the classification of French V1 compounds in Fradin (2009: 426), who also isolates forms
identifying events (baize-main [kiss hand] ‘hand-kissing’), places (coupe-gorge [cut throat] ‘dan-
gerous back alley’) and causative actions (pisse-chien [piss dog], name of a plant which makes
dogs urinate).
4 The analysis of Romance V1 types and their historical development is carried out by Bork
(1990), Gather (2001), and Nielsen Whitehead (2012).
5 Interpretations range from the idea that the FC is a third ps. sg. form (e.g. Schapira (1985)) or
an imperative (e.g. Darmesteter (1875: 146–205), Progovac (2012), to the view that it is a stem (e.g.
Benveniste (1966)). See also Chapter 3, section 8.
6 Progovac and Locke (2009), from where the Serbian example is quoted, deal particularly
with V1 compounds conveying insults.

that the V1 pattern originated in late-antique onomastic practices which spread
from Rome to the West Germanic and Slavic areas.8 The interpretation of the
Slavic evidence is not unanimous. Research carried out on South Slavic (Serbian)
by Progovac (2010) and Old Church Slavonic by Pohl (1973) tends to suggest that
the V1 pattern may have been productive in some Slavic varieties independently
of the phenomena of linguistic contact which characterize V1 compounds in East
and West Slavic.
      Latin obviously has a central role in our understanding of how the V1 com-
pounds spread in the languages of modern Europe. However, V1 compounds are
not only extremely rare in Classical Latin, but also of controversial interpreta-
tion.9 The classic handbook examples versipellis ‘that changes its skin’ (Plautus)
and flexanimus ‘that bends, affects the heart’ (Pacuvius) have been variously ana-
lysed. Speculatively, it may be argued that they continue an old pattern, employ-
ing old s-aorists (which provided the stem of some Latin perfects) in the FC:
however, this type of word formation is assumed to have been very restricted.10
On account of the literary use of these compounds, other scholars have claimed
that they are learned calques from the popular Greek type in -σι-.11
      An alternative analysis, adopted by Bork (1990), is to interpret these Latin
compounds as bahuvrihis containing past participles in the FCs: ‘having a
changed (versus) skin’, ‘having a bent (flexus), affected heart’. The latter meaning
is again attested in Pacuvius. Consistently with this interpretation, Bork (1990:
241–242) isolates only sixteen forms in which the FC can be interpreted as a simple
verbal stem and which are, in his opinion, real V1 compounds. His interpreta-
tion is endorsed by Nielsen Whitehead (2012: 114–129) who, after discarding a
few further examples, proposes a model of the evolution of V1 compounds in
Latin. She submits that the few Latin forms which can be interpreted as real V1
compounds were not inherited from PIE, but arose in Late or sub-standard Latin
and were influenced by the syntactic constituent order which characterized the
language at this stage.12 Sentence-names of the type Vincemalus ‘he who defeats

222–223) wonders whether versipellis, flexanimus and the likes might not belong to this ancient

evil’ also emerged at a late linguistic stage, and particularly in Christian Latin as
a result of Semitic influence.13
      In summary, in modern IE languages the V1 type is mostly productive in
Romance, possibly continuing a Late Latin pattern. The Classical roots of this
pattern are very hard to trace: the question of whether PIE had a class of V1 com-
pounds must therefore be assessed without using the Latin data.
2.1 The PIE background of V1 compounds
Evidence from the other ancient IE languages is uneven, in terms of both chro-
nology and quantity. V1 compounds are attested in Greek, Sanskrit (starting
with Vedic) and Iranian (starting with Old Persian); no original V1 compound
has been identified in Hittite and Luwian.14 The Greek τερψίμβροτος type, which
synchronically derives from the s-aorist, is an isolated formation: as noted in
Chapter 3, it is often interpreted as having an ancestor in the Vedic (and early
Greek) type in -ti-, but the state of the Vedic evidence is ambiguous, as we will see
shortly. Similarly, Indo-Iranian shows a common type represented by forms such
as Vedic bharád-vāja- ‘bringing trophy’ and Avestan dārayat-raθa- ‘maintaining
the chariot’ which finds no parallel in Greek and which is unlikely to continue a
PIE pattern.15 This type shows FCs which can be synchronically connected to par-
ticiples: it could have arisen from the re-analysis and extension of other inherited
V1 categories.16
      This leaves us with the Greek φερέοικος and βωτιάνειρα types. For the former,
good parallels can be found in Indo-Iranian, while the latter is only compara-
ble to Vedic forms. φερέοικος compounds have a counterpart in the Vedic type
trasá-dasyu- [shiver enemy] ‘making enemies shiver’ (< trásati ‘he trembles’) and
in the Avestan type niδā-snaiθiš- ‘laying down weapons’ (< niδā- ‘to put down’).17
In both φερέοικος and trasá-dasyu- the FC ends in a vowel which may derive from
the thematic vowel (*e regularly yields a in Sanskrit): these FCs would there-
fore contain thematic present stems. In Vedic, this -a may sometimes undergo
rhythmical lengthening, as in radā-vasu- ‘dispensing wealth’ (< rádati). On the
other hand, Av. niδā-snaiθiš- is likely to be built on the bare root, which ends in a

long vowel (niδā- ‘put down’ is a compound of ni ‘in’ and dā- ‘put’ < *dheh1-): this
type would therefore be similar to the few Greek compounds such as Τλήπολε-
μος which are based on the simple root. Compounds based on simple long-vowel
roots are also attested in Vedic: e.g. sth-raśman- ‘making reins firm, having firm
reins’, from *steh2-.18 The great majority of these not very common Indo-Iranian
compounds with FCs based on stems ending in -a- or on bare long-vowel roots,
have semantics which make them similar to bahuvrihis: for this reason, Nielsen
Whitehead (2012: 40–43) concludes that in this branch inherited V1 compounds
merged with bahuvrihis already at an early stage.
     A similar development seems to have affected Vedic compounds character-
ized by FCs ending in -ti-, which are also attested in Greek.19 In Vedic, these com-
pounds have meanings which allow their classification as bahuvrihis: this will
be argued in detail in section 4.3.2, which draws on work carried out by Nielsen
Whitehead (2012). As in the case of compounds with FCs ending in -a- or based on
bare roots, it is possible that Vedic re-analysed an inherited category which had
become obscure. In Greek FCs in -ti- are also residual: there are only six alphabetic
forms (̓ρτ́λοχος, Δωτώ, βητ́ρμων, βωτίνειρα, Καστιάνειρα and ἀρτιεπής: see
section 8), and up to eleven compounded PNs as well as a few Kurznamen of this
type can be identified in Mycenaean (sections 5 and 7). The common denomina-
tor of the alphabetic Greek forms is the fact that the -ti- element is preceded by
a root ending in a long vowel (Δωτώ, βητ́ρμων, βωτίνειρα), in [r] (̓ρτ́λοχος,
ἀρτιεπής) or in [d] (Καστιάνειρα < *kad-ti-, cf. κέκασμαι: see section 8.5). These
associations are also shown by the Mycenaean forms. Outside these categories
(which are, therefore, quite clearly defined on the basis of shared properties of
their verbal roots), the FCs in -ti- were replaced by those in -si-, which are the only
productive types in Greek. Whether compounds with FCs ending in -si- formally
continue those with FCs ending in -ti- or whether they represent a different type
is the bone of contention among linguists.
     Views on the origin of Greek compounds in -si- vary, as we saw in Chapter
3, sections 5 and 6. There is general consensus on the idea that the association
with the s-aorist is a Greek development, arising in the context of a derivational
system which productively created V1 compounds from a variety of sigmatic
forms (including the future and action nouns: see section 4). However, scholars
also tend to think that the -si- element derives from the -ti- element and hence
that it is a PIE relic, later re-analysed in Greek. As discussed in Chapter 3, section
6, these scholars often link the origin of the -ti- element to verbal nouns rather
18 For all these forms, see Wackernagel (1905: 316–317).
19 Duchesne-Guillemin (1936: 198) assumes that since Sanskrit preserves the type in -ti-,
Iranian must have inherited and later lost it.

than verbs, thus taking -ti- to continue a suffix contained in these nouns.20 As
stated in Chapter 3, the consequence of this theory would be that while -e- com-
pounds were based on verbs, -ti- compounds would be nominal in origin.
     A way to overcome this unfortunate separation of two compound types which
share many semantic and structural properties is to go back to the stem hypothe-
sis (Chapter 3, section 8) and to assume that the three types of FCs, characterized
by -e-, -ti- and -si-, contain stems or bare roots, sometimes followed by linking
elements. The study of the early development of Greek V1 compounds provided
in this chapter has its premise in the hypothesis that PIE possessed—at least in
its later phases—a V1 category which was split into two subtypes: the ancestor of
the Greek and Indo-Iranian type in -e/a-, and the ancestor of the Greek and Vedic
type in -ti-. The PIE origin of -si- compounds is more difficult to prove and must
therefore remain very tentative: section 6.1 discusses whether the hypothesis of
a late PIE origin of -si- compounds can bring any advantage to the interpreta-
tion of Greek V1 compounds. A useful observation to bear in mind is that in all
these ancient languages some of the inherited compound categories were re-in-
terpreted (compounds in -a- in Indo-Iranian, compounds in -ti- in Vedic) or grad-
ually lost (compounds in -ti- in Greek and Iranian). It may therefore be speculated
that Indo-Iranian lost the -si- type, if this goes back to a late PIE age.
2.2 Summary and working hypothesis: a late PIE bipartite system
The hypothesis that the early Greek and Vedic V1 compounds are the relics of a
late PIE bipartite system of V1 compounds (with FCs in -e- or in -ti-) is assessed
in the remainder of this chapter, and particularly in sections 5.1–8.7. Analysis of
the data starts from the assumption that the Greek φερέοικος and τερψίμβροτος
types, formal details aside, represent two faces of the same macro-category,
which is structurally and semantically coherent: their FCs are pure verbal roots
or stems, which may be further enlarged with the use of linking elements (-ti-, -i-
and sometimes -e- itself, when it is not part of the present stem but functions as a
linking vowel). Section 4.3.1 posits an original compound system in which FCs in
-ti- were not redundant or exceptional, but were on a par with those in -e-, from
which they formally differed because they were composed of bare roots followed
by the element -ti- rather than being based on the present stem. Section 4.3.2
applies this hypothetis to the Vedic material.

166          Chapter Four – The Historical Perspective
     This hypothesis takes Greek as its indispensable starting point, because of
the wealth and antiquity of its V1 stock. In order to proceed to a historical study
of V1 compounds, it is useful to add further details to the analysis of φερέοικος
and τερψ́μβροτος compounds provided in Chapter 2, section 7.5, focusing in
particular on the morphological make-up of their FCs. While the description of
the φερέοικος type is relatively straightforward from a synchronic point of view,
that of τερψ́μβροτος compounds—as we saw in the survey of previous work in
Chapter 3—is more complex. This is because the origin of their FC can, in princi-
ple, be posited in the noun as well as in the verb. For this reason, we first need to
have a good understanding of the stems employed in τερψ́μβροτος compounds
and of the relation between certain stems and certain linking elements, since
the various FCs (in -τι-, -σι-, -εσι-, -ησι-, -σε- and -σο-) have different origins and
developments: while the origin of -τι- and -σι- forms is clearly rooted in an early
linguistic phase, the development of compounds ending in -εσι-, -ησι-, -σε- and
-σο- follows inner-Greek compound patterns, largely influenced by analogical
processes.
3 φερ́οικος type: structure, stems and linking elements
Chapter 2, section 7.5.1 described the basic types of FCs represented in the
φερέοικος type. The guiding principle (which is admittedly quite broad) for a
compound to be subsumed under this type is its lack of the element -σι-. However,
there is a great variety in the type of stems or, more frequently, roots selected for
these FCs. The majority of FCs employ the stem of thematic radical presents, such
as φερε-: the element -ε- therefore derives from the thematic vowel, which char-
acterizes this type of presents.21 Such derivation from radical presents is predom-
inant in the synchronic development of φερέοικος compounds: see FCs such as
ἀγε-, ἀρχε-, βλεπε-, δερκε-, ἑλκε-, ἐχε-, μελε-, μενε- and πειθε-, all corresponding
to Greek thematic radical presents.
     A much more limited number of FCs is built on thematic suffixed presents
of which they retain the characterizing suffix or infix: for instance ἅπτε- from
ἅπτω (while the simple root is ἁπ- in Greek), κειρε- from κείρω (simple root
κερ-), δαμν(ε)- from δάμνημι (where -ν- is the infix characterizing the present).
21 As we saw in Chapter 3, there has been a long debate over the nature of the vocalic elements
at the end of the FCs and over whether these vowels provide information on the origin of the V1
type. The formal identity of the FC φερε- with the second person imperative φέρε ‘carry!’ has led
to the interpretation of this V1 category as a type of imperatival compounds (Chapter 3, sections
3 and 5).

                          3 φερ́οικος type: structure, stems and linking elements            167
However, the facts that the number of such FCs is limited, that the attestations of
the individual compounds employing them are few, and that the compounds are
usually associated with poetic language contribute to identifying this sub-type as
an oddity arising from the analogical extension of the original type of φερέοικος
compounds, those based on radical presents. Contextually, it is worth noting that
the verbs whose present is built with suffixes preferentially select the aorist stem
for their V1 compounds: see for instance δάκνω, FC δακε- (from ἔδακον) and not
**δακνε-; λαγχάνω, FC λαχε- (from ἔλαχον), not **λαγχανε-; βλάπτω, FC βλαψι-
(from ἔβλαψα), not **βλαπτε-. The derivation from the thematic aorist stem is
an important phenomenon in φερέοικος compounds: we will return to it in the
context of its association with the linking element -o-.
     A few other FCs of compounds that are subsumed, for the sake of conven-
ience, under the φερέοικος type end in vowels characteristic of roots which
in Greek build athematic presents, for instance ἐρυ- (Ἐρύλαος ‘one who keeps
off the enemy’) from ἔρυμαι ‘keep off’ (later remade into the thematic present
ἐρύομαι): here, the present stem coincides with the root.22 Another different case
is that of the FC Τλη- (Τληπόλεμος ‘one who endures war’), which derives from
the root employed in the aorist infinitive τλῆναι ‘endure’. As we will see, this type
of roots ending in a long vowel preferentially builds FCs in -ti-: the lack of this
linking element in Τληπόλεμος may identify it as an old creation, which did not
need being remade into a -ti- compound. A small number of FCs also end in -ι-,
a frequent linking vowel in ‘Caland’ compounds (Chapter 1, section 4.1) and in
τερψίμβροτος compounds: see those in ἀρχι- from ἄρχω or τερπι- from τέρπω.
     Finally, a defined group of FCs end in -ο- (λιπότεκνος ‘abandoning children’).
Some of these FCs employ zero-grade roots which are found in the thematic aorist
of ablauting verbs: e.g. ἔλιπον from λείπω. It may therefore be formally correct to
describe FCs such as λιπο- as thematic aorist stems, since -o- can be identified
with the thematic vowel. However, it is unlikely that this formation process goes
back to an early (pre-Greek) stage. The behaviour of -o-, as well as that of -ε- in
V1 compounds suggests that, at a synchronic stage at least, these vowels often
functioned as linking elements. In this function, they could be exported to other
compound categories. This is further confirmed by the way -o- and -ι- are selected
and extended to certain compound sub-types.
22 See also Risch (1974: 190–191) for the inclusion of these types of compounds in the φερέοικος
type.

168         Chapter Four – The Historical Perspective
3.1 FCs in -ο-
-ο- does not uniquely characterize compounds from zero-grade roots which
could therefore be analysed as employing the stem of the thematic aorist: it is
also found in a number of FCs which are not connected to any thematic aorist,
such as ἐθέλω ‘want’ > ἐθελο- (aorist ̓θέλησα) or βούλομαι ‘will’ > βουλο- (aorist
ἐβουλήθην). In these FCs, -o- may have been selected in the function of a mere
linking element. This seems to have happened through two different derivational
processes. The first has its starting point in nominal FCs which were re-inter-
preted as deriving from verbs. The model is the FC φιλο-, which characterized
bahuvrihis such as φιλόξενος (‘having guests dear’) and was later re-interpreted
as deriving from φιλέω (‘loving guests’).23 Risch (1974: 193) situates the analog-
ical process leading to the spread of -o- within the Homeric epics, arguing that
φιλοπτόλεμος ‘loving war’ influenced the shape of its antonym φυγοπτόλεμος
‘escaping war’, which has identical SC and prosody.24 φυγοπτόλεμος could then
have triggered the association of -o- with zero-grade roots, employed in thematic
aorist formations.
     In other cases, as we have seen for φιλο-, -o- seems to be influenced by the
existence of a noun or adjective in -ος (e.g. μῖσος ‘hatred’ > μισο-), though this
criterion, which could also apply to dozens of other FCs (e.g. ἀρχε- vs. ἀρχός
‘captain’), remains restricted. For an understanding of why -o- was selected
for FCs from certain verbs but not for others, it is useful to consider the role of
semantic analogy in the spread of this second derivational process. A number of
FCs ending in -o- express positive feelings or intentions: e.g. φιλο- ‘love’, βουλο-
‘will’, ἐθελο- ‘want’ and μελλο- ‘be about to’. Others indicate negative feelings
or intentions: e.g. μισο- ‘hate’, λιπο- ‘abandon / lack’ and φυγο- ‘avoid’. If Risch
(1974: 193) is correct in assuming that φιλοπτόλεμος triggered φυγοπτόλεμος after
φιλο- was re-analysed as a verbal stem, then it is possible to assume that other
FCs showing similar meanings to these two (‘love’ / want’, ‘avoid / hate’, etc.)
received the linking element -o- by analogy with these archetypes. Obviously
this explanation should be regarded as a guiding principle rather than as a rule.
Overall, many of the productive FCs in -o- seem to share a tendency to develop
special semantics or to become grammaticalised, as we will see in the analysis
of individual verbs in Chapters 5 and 6, and this provides early evidence for the
spread of -o- as a passepartout linking element in Greek.
23 See e.g. Brugmann (1905–1906: 66) and Chapter 6, section 5.
24 This might represent a development from φυγε- which may be attested in the Mycenaean
personal name pu2-ke-qi-ri (see section 5).

3.2 FCs in -ι-
As noted, a more restricted number of compound families of the φερέοικος type
show the linking element -ι-. Among these, those from ἄρχω have developed a
highly productive FC ἀρχι- which emerged alongside with the ‘regular’ ἀρχε-,
though in appellative compounds at least there is a clear semantic and functional
differentiation in that ἀρχι- is generally used as a prefix meaning ‘chief’ (see
analysis in Chapter 6, section 3.1). According to Risch, this -ι- derives from the
wrong segmentation of the compound ἀρχ-ιερεύς ‘chief-priest’ (Hdt.)—one of the
first compounds from ἄρχω in which the FC acquires the meaning of ‘chief’—into
ἀρχι-ερεύς. He argues that this first example could have influenced another form,
ἀρχιτέκτων ‘master-builder’ (Hdt.), and that the FC ἀρχι- was eventually selected
as a determiner restricted to the specialist terminology of private and public pro-
fessions, enjoying a high degree of productivity in Hellenistic and Roman times.25
     Risch’s idea, however, is rather implausible in that it makes a single form
responsible for a huge phenomenon of analogical extension. It is much more
likely that -ι- is analogical on τερψ́μβροτος compounds.26 At least two FCs of
φερέοικος compounds might be understood to be of the τερψίμβροτος type
because their roots end in [s]: ἀλεξι- and ἀεξι-. Moreover, there is a manifest
degree of artificial overlap between the FCs of the φερέοικος type and those of
the τερψίμβροτος type: a few τερψίμβροτος compounds have the FC ending in
-ε- or -ο- (e.g. ἀκερσε- and στρεψο-, see below) and a whole sub-group of forms in
-εσι (e.g. ἑλκ-ε-σι-) may result from the conflation of both types.
4 τερψ́μβροτος type: structure, stems and linking elements
The overview of the τερψ́μβροτος type in Chapter 2 section 7.5.1 has shown that
in this category too the FCs take different shapes because of the use of differ-
ent linking elements. However, FCs in -τι- (βωτιάνειρα), -σε- (περσέπτολις) and
-σο- ( ̓Αμευσόπολις) are much more restricted than the pervasive -σι-. The general
rule holds that this marker is associated with verbs which produce a sigmatic
aorist or future so that in the great majority of cases it is correct to say that -σ-
is part of the selected verbal stem and only -ι- is an authentic linking element.
This derivational rule is absolutely regular and the exceptions involve only the
25 Risch (1949: 282–283).
26 See Schwyzer (1939: 444). On early morphological interpretations of -ι-, which are now
linguistically untenable, see the overview in Clemm (1867: 45–103).

170         Chapter Four – The Historical Perspective
FCs ἀγερσι- and ἐγερσι- from verbs ἀγείρω and ἐγείρω, which do not have tenses
characterized by -σι-.
     In the formation of sigmatic tenses, consonantal roots add -σ- directly to the
root and the resulting FCs employ this sigmatic stem: examples are διώκω > aorist
ἐδίωξα > FC διωξι-; ἁρπάζω > aorist ἥρπαξα > FC ἁρπαξι-; and ἐρείπω > aorist
ἤρειψα > FC ἐρειψι-. Vocalic roots too add -σ- to their root in the full grade: for
instance, δ́δωμι > future δώσω > FC δωσι- or ἀκούω > aorist ἤκουσα > FC ἀκουσι-.
FCs from verba vocalia in -έω and -άω usually show FCs in -ησι- and -ᾱσι- (which
becomes -ησι- in Attic-Ionic), since the stem of their sigmatic tenses regularly
lengthens the vowel: examples are αἱρέω > future αἱρήσω > FC αἱρησι- and νικάω
> future νικήσω, aorist ἐνίκησα > FC νικησι-.
     Hovewer, -έω verbs which have their original sigmatic tenses in -εσ-, i.e.
without lengthening the vowel, accordingly tend to have FCs characterized by
-εσι-: an example is καλέω > aorist ἐκάλεσα > FC καλεσι-. Since many of these
-έω verbs are characterized by analogical phenomena, which lead to the crea-
tion of secondary sigmatic tenses in -ησ-, FCs in -ησι- may come to coexist with
those in -εσι-. An example is αἰνέω: it produces two aorists, ᾔνησα and ᾔνεσα,
which provide the stem for the FCs αἰνεσι- and αἰνησι-. This situation is the result
of the complex history of -έω verbs which—as demonstrated by Tucker (1990)—
result from the conflation of different verbal classes and may thus have different
paradigms. FCs in -ησι- also regularly feature in compounds from verbs which
have futures in -ησ- (but aorists of another type): for instance, εὑρίσκω > future
εὑρ́σω > FC εὑρησι- (vs. aorist εὗρον); ἁνδάνω > future ἁδ́σω > FC ἁδησι- (vs.
aorist ἕαδον); κιχάνω > future κιχ́σομαι > FC κιχησι- (vs. aorist ἔκιχον).
     Leaving aside the issue of the origin of τερψ́μβροτος compounds and the spe-
cific analogical mechanisms behind the less common FCs, which will be tackled
in the next sections, it is clear that from a synchronic point of view τερψ́μβροτος
compounds were a popular category in Greek because speakers connected them
to sigmatic tenses (the aorist and the future): if this identification was possible,
τερψίμβροτος compounds could in principle be created from any of these verbal
forms.
4.1 FCs in -εσι-, -σε- and -σo-
The popularity of compounds ‘characterized by -σι-’ also led to the exportation
of -σι-, as well as -εσι-, to FCs from verbs which did not have sigmatic tenses.
This confirms that, derivational rules aside, -σι- was perceived as a marker of this
class of compounds as a whole. We considered above the FCs ἀγερσι- and ἐγερσι-
in which -σι- does not derive from a sigmatic tense: it is interesting to note that

these FCs are rare and characterize compounds with a clear literary pedigree (see
Chapter 6, section 3.2, and Chapter 5, section 5.1.1).
     There are also several examples of the marker -εσι- being exported to com-
pounds from verbs which do not have tenses in -εσ-. Most instances of analogical
extension of -εσι- are found in FCs from verbs which lack sigmatic tenses: con-
sider ἄγω > ἀγεσι-, ἀλφάνω > ἀλφεσι-, ἐγείρω > ἐγρεσι-, μένω > μενεσι-, τέμνω >
ταμεσι-, and φέρω > φερεσ(ι)-. Many of these analogical compounds correspond
to an established φερέοικος type (e.g. ἀγεσι-, ἐγρεσι-, μενεσι- and φερεσι- vs. the
more common ἀγε-, ἐγρε-, μενε- and φερε- types), of which they may represent
the ‘longer’ (and thus metrically useful) variant.27
     The artificiality of forms in -εσι- is also shown by the fact that many of these
FCs are isolated: for instance, ἀλφεσι-, occurring only once in the Homeric epithet
ἀλφεσ́βοιος ‘bringing in oxen’, may well have been formed in this way to fit a
hexametric line; καμπεσι- only occurs in two very late compounds; ἑλκεσι-, only
found in the Homeric compound ἑλκεσίπεπλος ‘trailing the robe’, was probably
created to avoid the cretic in the regular **ἑλκέπεπλος; Helen’s epithet λιπεσάνωρ
‘abandoning her husband’ (Stes.) was a poetic alternative to popular compounds
in λιπ(o)-. Similarly artificial is the FC πειθεσι-, attested only once in the PN
Πειθεσίλεως (fourth c. BC), perhaps a fancy substitute of the more common
names in πεισι- and πειθε-.
     FCs ending in -σε- and -σο- likewise derive largely from analogy with
φερέοικος compounds. In Archaic Greek there are only two FCs ending in -σε-:
ἀκερσε- and περσε-. In both cases -ε- is a mere linking element imported from
φερέοικος compounds and does not have any special function, pace Chantraine
and Bader, according to whom -σε- represents an old desiderative stem.28 This
hypothesis, impossible to prove on semantic and morphological grounds, does
not explain why such ‘desideratives’ are not found in the FCs of other com-
pounds. In particular, there is another reason to consider ἀκερσεκόμης ‘who does
not shear his hair’ a peculiar formation. Its FC is negated by ἀ-, something which
is exceptional in V1 compounds (it only occurs in ἀστεργής ‘not loving’). In some
sense, the structure of this compound resembles that of negated bahuvrihis,
although the FC does not match any known adjective.29 All these features concur
in identifying ἀκερσεκόμης as a poetic formation with a high degree of artificial-
27 See also Specht (1932: 69).
28 See DEG s.v. ἀκερσεκόμης and Bader (1974: 3), according to whom forms in -σε- ‘sont tous bâtis
sur des formes de présents thématiques dérivés (comme Χαιρε- en regard de χαίρω), qui sont des
présents en *-se/o-’.
29 The negative prefix also precedes the FC in the Sophoclean ἀκειρεκόμης (identical meaning),
which is clearly based on the Homeric compound.

ity. It must also be noted that in Homer the only sigmatic finite form of κέρω is
the aorist third ps. sg. κέρσε / ἔκερσεν: the original FC **κερσι- might have been
altered into κερσε- through the influence of this verbal form.
      As for περσέπτολις, the formula πόλιν πέρσε / πέρσειν occurs at least six
times in the poems, thus representing a strong model for the compound (see in
particular πέρσεν δὲ πόλιν in Il. 19.296).30 -ε- also occurs in two PNs from ὄρνυμι,
 ̓Ορσεδίκη and  ̓Ορσέλαος, in which -σε- is again preceded by -ρ-. In all likelihood,
the -ε- deriving from φερέοικος compounds spread to the τερψ́μβροτος type fol-
lowing formal analogy.
      The linking element -o- is found in a few PNs ( ̓Αμευσόπολις,  ̓Ορσοάλτιος,
 ̓Ορσόβαρις) and in a handful of appellatives mostly of very late age. In all cases
we face late developments of much more common types: thus Claudius Aelianus’
λειψόθριξ ‘having lost their hair’ and λειψοσέληνον ‘the moon’s first or last
quarter’, found in the third-century anonymous treatise De viribus herbarum,
are by-products of the type in λιπο-. Two compounds in στρεψo-, στρεψοδικέω
‘twist the law’ and the derivation στρεψοδικοπανουργία ‘cunning in the perver-
sion of justice’, are found in Aristophanes, himself the source of the only other
τερψ́μβροτος compound derived from στρέφω ‘twist’ (στρεψίμαλλος ‘with
tangled fleece’).
      An interesting case of a τερψ́μβροτος class in -o- is the one from μέγνυμι,
in which the FC μιξο- functions as a sort of prefix meaning ‘mixed’ or ‘half’ (e.g.
μιξόμβροτος ‘half-human’: see analysis in Chapter 5, section 4.4). As in the case of
ἀρχι- discussed above, this understanding represents a development of the orig-
inal verbal meaning of the compounds, identifying someone ‘who mixes with’
(e.g. Μειξίδημος ‘he who mingles with the people’, μιξοβάρβαρος ‘mingling with
barbarians’).31 Starting from these early forms, the FC in -o- came to identify a
new class of compounds, whose semantics is more of the determinative kind. As
noted in section 3.1, -o- tends to associate itself with verbal FCs which are liable
to develop substantival or adjectival semantics.
4.2 The synchronic role of action nouns
In their diachronic development from Classical Greek onwards, τερψ́μβροτος
compounds are also supported by the similarity with action nouns in -σις, which
contribute to the creation of a regular derivational system based on different

have been linked to it by folk-etymology, see the analysis in Chapter 6, section 3.2.

formations characterized by the -s- marker. This system, which decrees that the
τερψ́μβροτος type is more common than the φερέοικος type, developed par-
ticularly in the late Classical period, when action nouns seem to have greatly
increased.32 From the structural point of view, action nouns simply provide the
formal pattern on which certain FCs are based: the compounds, however, are
fully V1 compounds and not left-oriented [N N] formations.
     The dynamics at play in the influence of action nouns on τερψίμβροτος
compounds can be better understood by looking at the development that this
inherited class of nominals underwent in Greek. In early Greek, action nouns
were originally derived from the zero grade of roots,33 but in Classical Greek they
started to be created from verbal roots showing no ablaut, thus acquiring a full
grade instead of the expected zero grade.34 The influence of these later forma-
tions on τερψίμβροτος compounds is clear: see e.g. ἔγερσις ‘awaking’ (Hippocr.)
> FC ἐγερσι-, φεῦξις ‘flight, escape’ (Soph.) > FC φευξι-, ἄγερσις ‘gathering’ (Hdt.)
> FC ἀγερσι-. In this way action nouns came to be part of a system of forms sharing
the presence of -σ-, to the extent that the compositional -σι- was perceived as an
exportable suffix.35 This is the reason behind the spread of -σι- to the φερέοικος
type, as argued above. This passepartout nature of the -σι- element in Classical
Greek may also have been encouraged by the fact that -σι- also featured outside
V1 compounds, since there were compounds whose FCs derived from dative
plurals, such as ναυσίκλυτος or ἐγχεσίμωρος.
4.3 FCs in -τι-
Mycenaean and Homeric language also attest to the existence of a residual com-
pound type characterized by a FC ending in -ti-. Most of these compounds are
opaque as concerns the morphology of their FCs, which cannot be connected
to any existing verbal tense or verbal noun characterized by -t- except for agent
nouns. As we have seen in Chapter 3 (sections 4.4 and 5.1), many scholars have
claimed, with various arguments, that compounds in -ti- were the oldest type
of τερψ́μβροτος compounds and this is the reason why they are treated here. It
is also widely accepted that at a later stage these original -ti- forms underwent

assibilation to -si-, triggering the formation of a new and independent class of
compounds characterized by -si- and synchronically linked to sigmatic tenses
(τερψ́μβροτος). The theories put forward by these scholars—different in the
details as they may be—have a common basis: that the FC of τερψ́μβροτος com-
pounds originally was not a verb but a noun (either an action noun or an agent
noun), and that its association with the s-aorist was a later development. One of
the most recent of revivals of this hypothesis is the argument that was voiced by
Jochem Schindler, who claimed that the ancestors of τερψ́μβροτος compounds
were bahuvrihis with an action noun in the FC:
     Der ursprüngliche Stammausgang -τι- des in der Wurzel hochstufigen Kompositionsanfangs-
     glieds wurde durch die Assibilation zu -σι-. Danach entsprach das Wortstück vor dem ι
     (τερψ-) dem Stamm der sigmatischen Tempora Aorist und Futurum. In der Folge hängt die
     Bildemöglichkeit von TK [τερψίμβροτος-Komposita] von der Existenz eines (synchron) sig-
     matischen Tempusstammes ab, ohne daß jedoch die Funktion dieser Stämme vom Komp.
     übernommen wird; δηξίθυμος unterscheidet sich semantisch nicht von δακέθυμος.
     Schindler (1997: 539).
The second part of Schindler’s statement may well serve as a rule of thumb for the
synchronic analysis of τερψίμβροτος compounds and their productivity which,
as we have seen, depends on the possibility of linking the FC to an existing sig-
matic tense. However, we must carefully evaluate the two related sides of the dia-
chronic dimension of his theory. First, the question of whether it can be posited
that the FC of these compounds derives from old action nouns, which raises the
problem of the unusual structure and orientation of the compounds; secondly,
whether the idea that FCs in -ti- are the unassibilated ancestors of FCs in -si- is
tenable. We will tackle the morphological and structural issues first, focusing on
the controversial Vedic evidence as well.
4.3.1 Do Greek FCs in -ti- and -si- go back to old action or agent nouns?
The assumption that forms in -ti- and -si- originally contained action or agent
nouns rather than verbal stems needs revising, for three different reasons. As far
as the action noun hypothesis is concerned, this is in no way supported by the
Greek evidence, as already noted by Knecht (1946)—who, however, still accepted
it. As the data in Table 4.1 show, the root grade of most Greek -σις nouns is dif-
ferent from the root grade of the FCs in -τι-, so that a derivation of these early V1
compounds from the corresponding action nouns is difficult.
     The discrepancy with the vocalic grade of the corresponding action nouns also
concerns many of the fifty-one -si- compounds attested between the second mil-
lennium and the seventh c. BC, which represent the oldest layer of τερψίμβροτος

is never attested in Greek: ἀείρω (ἀερσίπους), ἀλφάνω (ἀλφεσίβοιος), ἀνάσσω

κείρω (ἀκερσεκόμης), κλέπτω (κλεψίφρων), μιμνήσκω (ma-na-si-we-ko), ὄλλυμι
(ὀλεσήνωρ), πίμπλημι (πλησίστιος), σπένδω (Σπενσίθεος), τέμνω (ταμεσίχρως),
φάω (φαεσίμβροτος).
      Another thirteen verbs produce an action noun, but this is attested much later
than the compounds: ἀάω > ἀεσίφρων (ἄεσις, Hsch.), ἄγαμαι >  ̓Αγασίλεως (ἄγασις,
EM), ἀλέξω > a-re-ka-sa-da-ra (ἄλεξις, Aristid.), αἰνέω > Αἰνησιμβρότᾱ (αἴνεσις,
LXX), δαμάζω > δαμασίμβροτος (δάμασις, Sch. Soph.), ἔραμαι >  ̓Ερασιμένης
(ἔρασις, EM), ἡγέομαι >  ̔Αγησιχόρα (ἥγησις, LXX), πείθω > Πείσανδρος (πεῖσις,
Plot.), πέρθω > περσέπτολις (πέρσις, Aristot.), πήγνυμι > πηγεσίμαλλος (πῆξις,

τιμάω > Τιμησικλῆς (τίμησις, Pl.).
      The most cogent point is that the FC of many of the oldest -si- compounds
shows the full grade of the verbal stem, whereas the attested action nouns are all
in the zero grade: see βαίνω > Ἀναβησ́λεως (βᾰ́σις), ἵστημι > Στησίχορος (στᾰ́σις),
36 The interpretation of most Mycenaean specimina is tentative: for this reason, they are not
included here (see sections 7.1–7.9 for a full discussion). I have not included in this list the PN
Τριπτόλεμος which Janda (2000: 24–35) considers to be an obscured V1 compound derived from
τρίβω ‘to crush’ and ἔλυμος ‘millet’ (for the initial vowel he compares the EM gloss ὀλεμεύς ‘gath-
erer’), yielding the meaning ‘he who crushes millet’. I consider this interpretation dubious.

These data support Dunkel’s claim that ‘the -σι-forms are as closely related to the
s-aorist as they are distant from nouns in *-ti-’.37
     Since the formation rules of action nouns in PIE are debated, it may still be
possible to assume that the Greek situation is the result of analogical levelling, by
which the compound FCs generalized the full grade of PIE action nouns, while the
simplicia generalized the zero grade.38 However, the problem that this left-oriented
structure is extraordinary in the IE languages, as argued below, would still remain.
     We have seen that, according to Schindler, originally τερψίμβροτος com-
pounds were bahuvrihis with action nouns in the FC and another noun in the
SC: i.e., if we use τερψίμβροτος as an example, ‘having delight (τέρψις) of men’.
According to Schindler, these bahuvrihis conveyed a special factitive meaning
(‘making men happy, delighting men’), which later triggered their association
with verbs. But, if this reconstruction is correct, we would be positing that PIE
had a large class of left-oriented [N N] bahuvrihis, with the determinatum occur-
ring on the left. This issue is completely overlooked in current discussions of the
V1 type, but needs careful consideration since the evidence from all the ancient
IE languages, and from most of the modern languages as well, shows that such
‘reversed bahuvrihis’ are exceptional, and often arise within the individual lan-
guages for specific morphological or semantic reasons (see Chapter 2, section 7.2):
arguing for the existence of a whole class of this type for PIE has important conse-
quences for the way we think about the PIE compound system. It is telling that the
theories which implicitly posit the existence of such a reversed structure in PIE
37 Dunkel (1992: 214).
38 The views of Indo-Europeanists on the formation of action nouns diverge. According to
some, for instance Rix (1979: 736), the original pattern was proterodynamic: strong forms had
the full grade of the root and zero grade of the suffix, while weak forms had zero grade in the
root and full grade in the suffix. The zero grade shown by many historical action nouns has been
considered to arise from an early PIE analogical levelling, which wiped out the full grade from
the productive formation of action nouns: see for instance Rix (1992: 358). On the other hand,
other scholars—for instance Vine (2004)—maintain that this analogical levelling happened only
quite late and that action nouns continuing the full-grade forms are still attested in some of the
individual languages. Vine’s chronology is heavily dependent on his interpretation of the FCs of
τερψίμβροτος and dti-vāra- compounds as old action nouns, based on the full grade of the root.

also end up positing that it conveys special semantics, a feature which is evident
in Schindler’s class of ‘factitive bahuvrihis’.
      Admittedly, the Vedic evidence is often used as crucial support in favour
of the existence of compounds characterized by action nouns in -ti- in PIE. But
the second reason why the action noun hypothesis seems untenable concerns
precisely these Vedic examples. In a nutshell (the evidence is analysed in full in
section 4.3.2), in Vedic the -ti- type is not common at all and half of the attested
forms seem to be mutually influenced: ṕṣṭi-gu- ‘making cows prosper’ and
śŕṣṭi-gu- ‘making cows obedient’(?) occur in the same line, have the same SC
and their FCs rhyme with each other, while vītí-rādhas- ‘enjoying the gift’ and
vītí-hotra- ‘enjoying the offering’ have the same FC (more on these compounds
in the next section). The Vedic compounds in -ti-, as argued below, are certainly
liable to be interpreted as ‘reversed bahuvrihis’, but their very rarity and highly
poetic pedigree is a confirmation of their exceptional status, which we should be
cautious in attributing to the parent language without further thought.
      The same structural problems affect the other theory on the origin of FCs in
-ti-, the one which—starting from the fact that the root employed in some agentive
nouns and compounds characterized by -t- is identical to that employed in the FCs
of V1 compounds in -ti—suggests that these compounds originally contained agent
nouns (Chapter 3, section 6).39 As sections 5.1 and 6 argue, the idea that -t- and -i-
represent compositional devices specifically used to make it possible to derive com-
pound constituents from certain kinds of roots is a useful one. However, the corol-
lary that these FCs represent real agent nouns must be discarded because, again,
we would be facing a left-oriented compound category of the head-determiner kind
which is unusual in Greek and unlikely to have existed in PIE. The issue of the struc-
ture displayed by these compounds is overlooked by the scholars who subscribe to
this hypothesis. Moreover, since V1 compounds are invariably adjectives, it would
remain to be explained how these compounds employing agent nouns (which are
substantives) in the FC could become adjectives: what is not clear is whether a tran-
sition is envisaged from an endocentric character of these compounds in an earlier
phase to their exocentric character in Greek.
4.3.2 The action nouns hypothesis: excursus on the Vedic evidence
As noted, the starting point of the theory which interprets the original FC of
τερψ́μβροτος compounds as an action noun is necessarily the Vedic layer of
Sanskrit, where there are no compounds in -si- and there are ten compounds in

-ti-. Wackernagel (1905: 320) lists only six compounds: dti-vara- (RV 1.167.8),
ṕṣṭi-gu- (RV 8.3.1b), vītí-rādhas (RV 9.62.29c), rīty-p- (RV 5.68.5a; 9.106.9c),
vītí-hotra- (RV 1.84.18.d, etc.) and vr̥ṣṭí-dyāv- (RV 5.68.5a). To these, Nielsen White-
head (2012: 44–46) adds abhiṣṭí-dyumna- ‘whose glory is a help/protection’ (RV
4.51.7b), abhíṣṭi-śavas- ‘rendering powerful assistance’ (RV 3.59.8b) ásamāty-ojas-
(RV 6.29.6c) ‘of unequalled strength’ and śŕṣṭi-gu- (RV 8.51.1d). She argues that in
all these Vedic compounds, except dti-vara-, the FC could be an action noun and
that they could be reversed bahuvrihis.40
      ṕṣṭi-gu-, a personal name, is glossed by Wackernagel as ‘making cows
prosper’, an interpretation implying that the FC is a verbal form from puṣ- ‘to
prosper, to make prosper’.41 The interpretation as a bahuvrihi, suggested by Nielsen
Whitehead, is equally possible if one takes the FC to correspond to the action
noun ṕṣṭi (or, with alternative accentuation, puṣṭí) ‘growth, increase, prosperity’.
ṕṣṭi-gu- would thus mean ‘having prosperity of cows’ (left-oriented structure) or
‘having cows of prosperity’ (right-oriented structure). As Nielsen Whitehead (2012:
46) points out, in the same Rig-Vedic line ṕṣṭi-gu- is followed by śŕṣṭi-gu- which
may contain the action noun śruṣṭí- ‘obedience’ (i.e. ‘having obedient cows’): the
two compounds are clearly connected by rhyming principles.
      Three of the remaining compounds listed by Wackernagel (1905: 320) cor-
respond to Vedic action nouns. Rīty-p- ‘moving water’ or ‘having a course of
water’ corresponds to rītí- ‘motion, course’.42 Vītí-rādhas- ‘enjoying the gift’ and
vītí-hotra- ‘enjoying the offering’ correspond to vītí- ‘enjoyment, feast’ and could
be understood as ‘having enjoyment of gifts’ and ‘having enjoyment of offerings’
respectively.43 Finally, the FC of vr̥ṣṭí-dyāv- ‘having a rainy sky’ is connected to
varṣ- ‘to rain’. Wackernagel (1905: 320) interprets this compound as a factitive
V1 compound meaning ‘making the sky rain’, but Nielsen Whitehead (2012:
48) notes the formal similarity of its FC with the adjective vr̥ṣṭimánt- ‘rainy’. In
Vedic, like in other ancient IE languages, denominal adjectives are not admitted
as compound constituents: the FC vr̥ṣṭi- could therefore cover for the adjective
vr̥ṣṭimánt-. The other compounds added by Nielsen Whitehead are all compatible
with Vedic action nouns as well.44
40 According to Nielsen Whitehead (2012: 40), this explains why the Sanskrit grammarians did
not discuss these compounds at all. The V1 interpretation however remains the most popular
among scholars: see recently Remmer (2007: 121).
41 This agrees with Wackernagel’s idea that the FC of these compounds derived from infinitives
in -ti-.

     Dti-vara- ‘giving gifts’ is more obscure. While the FC dāti- in theory points to
an action noun from dā- ‘give’ (< *deh3-), such a simplex is not attested. Moreover,
the meaning of this hypothetical bahuvrihi, ‘whose treasures are gifts’, would
not be straightforward.45 Therefore, the question remains open as to whether
dti-vara- may be the only relic of a truly V1 type which Vedic has otherwise lost.
     As noted in the previous section, the use of action nouns as compound FCs
in left-oriented compounds goes both against the structural tendencies that
can be reconstructed for the PIE compound system and the practice of Greek,
where no such bahuvrihis exist (τερψ́μβροτος compounds being construed as
V1 compounds based on s-stem tenses by speakers). A few words on this topic
are now necessary, since Nielsen Whitehead (2012) does not address the issue
of compound orientation. The ‘odd’ Vedic bahuvrihis with action nouns in the
FC can be better understood if one considers that in this language right-oriented
compounds with an action noun in the SC are extremely common.46 The devel-
opment of a full class of compounded action nouns parallels the high number of
simplicia, which are derived both from roots in the zero grade and from roots in
the full grade, and in Classical Sanskrit generally from every kind of verb.47
     Synchronically speaking, Vedic compounds such as ṕṣṭi-gu- may then rep-
resent the left-oriented counterpart of the more widespread types employing
action nouns in the SC. In view of the fact that Sanskrit, just like Greek, shows
an overwhelming tendency towards right-oriented compounds (the right-headed
determinative type being the most common), the likely conclusion is that the very
rare Vedic compounds in -ti- containing action nouns in the FC arose in poetic
language out of the reanalysis of other types. It is likely that if PIE ever had V1
compositional type with FCs ending in -ti- this did not survive in Sanskrit as such.
A similar conclusion was reached by Specht, who explained the Sanskrit type
with action nouns in the FC as a Sanskrit development, arising from the reinter-
pretation of an old PIE class which had become obscure in this language.48
5 -ti- and -si- forms in Greek: the Mycenaean evidence
If we discard the idea that the FC of forms in -ti- contained nominal stems, we are
left with the hypothesis that they contain verbal stems or roots. As already noted,
the nature of the -ti- element itself is obscure: in order to assess how it could

relate to verbal stems, we must consider its relation with -si-, both in Greek and
in a prospective reconstructed phase. Insofar as concerns the beginnings of the V1
type in Greek, the fundamental question is whether we should posit that FCs in
-si- uniquely derive from the assibilation of those in -ti- (which must therefore be
considered as the only authentic type at a PIE stage) or whether it may be possible
to assume that a -si- type had already developed before assibilation took place, i.e.
prior to Mycenaean. In this latter scenario, we would have to assume that -ti- and
-si- characterized two parallel but separate compound types, both possibly of late
PIE age.49
      In order to answer these questions, a careful examination of the Mycenaean
evidence is mandatory, since in second-millennium Greek compounds in -ti- are
still as numerous as those in -si-. In Mycenaean, V1 compounds are only attested
as PNs. Including many uncertain forms, the total number reaches thirty-nine
forms (twenty φερέοικος compounds and nineteen τερψ́μβροτος compounds),
though the syllabic script and the inherent difficulty in the analysis of PNs deter-
mines that the interpretation of many of these forms is speculative.50

compounds, but the proposed interpretations are unconvincing. The analysis of ke-u-po-da as
/kheu-spondās/ ‘libation-pourer’ and da-i-ja-ke-re-u as /dahi-agrēus/ ‘land-divider’ defy all for-
mation rules of the V1 type: in the first compound we would expect the FC to be /khewe-/, while
the FC /dahi/, if it derives from /dasi/ < *das- ‘divide’, would show lenition of intervocalic [s], a
phenomenon not attested by other Mycenaean V1 compounds. As for we-a-re-pe and we-je-ke-a2,
qualifying oil and wheels respectively, the supposed verbal FC we- does not allow a clear inter-
pretation. See Waanders (2008: 16–19), and also DMic s.vv.

182          Chapter Four – The Historical Perspective
In the φερέοικος type (table 4.2) all FCs end in -e- or are elided: as far as we can
tell, there are no FCs ending in -i- and -o- (with the exception of those in φιλο-
which, however, have a special status, see section 3.1). In the τερψ́μβροτος type
(table 4.3), on the other hand, both FCs in -s(i)- and in -t(i)- are attested.
     Although not all the PNs in tables 4.2 and 4.3 have met with unanimous inter-
pretation, a number of them are widely agreed upon: for instance a-ke-wa-ta,
e-ke-da-mo, a-re-ka-sa-da-ra, e-ke-me-de, ma-na-si-we-ko, ne-ti-ja-no, o-ti-na-wo,
and ke-sa-da-ra.53 Once the superficial obscurity of the syllabic script is resolved,
it appears that most first and second constituents of V1 Mycenaean compounds
may be antecedents of those featuring in widely attested first-millennium names.
The Mycenaean V1 compounds that have identical alphabetic parallels are
a-ke-ra-wo (Ἀγέλᾱος or Ἀρχέλᾱος), pi-ro-pa-ta-ra (~ Φιλοπ́τωρ), a-re-ka-sa-da-ra
(Ἀλεξ́νδρα), e-ti-ra-wo (~ ̓ρσ́λᾱος), ka-sa-no (~ Κ́σσανδρος), ke-sa-da-ra and
ke-sa-do-ro (Κεσ́νδρα, a variant attested on Corinthian vases), ma-na-si-we-ko
(Μνησ́εργος), ne-ti-ja-no (~ Νέσσανδρος), qa-sa-ko (Π́σσαρχος), ta-si-ko-no (~
Στᾱσιγόνη), ta-ta-ke-u (~ Στ́σαρχος).54
     Other names do not have an identical parallel in alphabetic Greek, but may
be continued by forms with the opposite orientation, for instance pi-ro-wo-na
(~ ̓ινόφιλος) or me-ti-ja-no (~ Ἀνδρομ́δης). A remarkable element of continuity
between the two stages of the Greek language is the preservation of cultic epithets
in ἐνοσί- (e-ne-si-da-o-ne, ἐννοσίδας, ἐνοσίχθων, εἰνοσίφυλλος, ἐννοσίγαιος:
although the differences in the shape of the FCs are problematic), which held
ground in spite of the lack of a Greek verb from this verbal root.55 These corre-
spondences show that archaic Greek onomastics continues a compound type
which was already fully developed in Mycenaean.
     In other names the constituents do not match attested alphabetic Greek forms,
but their structure and semantics are expressed by synonyms, or ‘substitutive

add pu2-ke-qi-ri, which García Ramón (2009) interprets as following the semantic
pattern ‘escaping (a heavy) evil’ (thus corresponding to alphabetic forms such as
Φυγόλιμος ‘escaping hunger’).
5.1 Are -ti- forms the ancestors of -si- forms?
If forms in -ti- are the ancestors of those in -si-, we must conclude that Mycenaean
represents a stage in which the replacement of -ti- with -si- had not been com-
pleted yet. The evaluation of the factors impeding the replacement of -ti- forms
with -si- forms must start from consideration of the dynamics of assibilation,
the phonological innovation yielding the change of [ti] into [si], which many
Greek varieties, and among them Mycenaean, underwent. Assibilation concerns
the voiceless dentals [t] and [th] followed by [i] and [e], which become sibilants
after an intermediate stage as affricates ([ts]).57 The Linear B tablets, however,
also contain a good number of forms in which the sound change has not taken
place: e.g. the place-name do-ti-ja /Dōtiā/ or the adjective me-ri-ti-jo /melitios/
‘honeyed’.58
     Among these unassibilated forms there are V1 PNs with the FC ending in -ti-.
There are two possible interpretations for the lack of assibilation in these FCs.
First, it may be assumed that assibilation had run to completion in Mycenaean,
but that -ti- survived in many compound FCs owing to the conservative nature of
onomastics. A similar explanation has been offered for the coexistence of ̓ρτίλο-
χος and ̓ρσίλοχος in Homeric Greek: the former could be regarded as a more
conservative form (see section 8.1). The second possibility is that in these V1 PNs
assibilation of [ti] into [si] was blocked in certain environments, failing to run to
completion. Work on failed assibilation in Mycenaean has been carried out by
Thompson (2008), who mentions analogy and lexical diffusion as two phenom-
ena likely to have interfered with assibilation.
     If we follow this second path, it is necessary to find specific factors of a mor-
phological, phonological or analogical nature which could have intervened to
block assibilation in V1 FCs in -ti-. In this respect, it is fundamental to realize that
the Mycenaean compounds preserving -ti- are of two different types. In the first

type, -ti- is preceded by [s], be it original (as in compounds in /nesti/ from *nes-)
or secondary (as in compounds in /mēsti/ from *mēd- or in /kasti/ from *k ̑n̥d-).
In these forms, when the cluster [sti] is followed by a consonant (the initial sound
of the SC), [sti] is blocked by the phonetic environment, since the dental is not
in intervocalic position.59 When the SC begins with a vowel some compounds
which can be reconstructed as having contained the cluster [sti] appear to have
undergone another sound-change, palatalization. Palatalization is a process by
which a consonant comes to be pronounced with the tongue against the palate.
In Greek, this happens with dentals and velars followed by a closed vowel (e.g.
[i]), which occurs before another vowel: [i] becomes a glide, [j]. At a first stage
the articulation of the consonant preceding the glide is moved back towards the
palate. In Greek, this change also produces a current of air between consonant
and vowel, which is similar to that produced by sibilants: as a result, [tj] becomes
[tsi] or [ssi] (note that the geminate is represented by simple s in the Linear B
spelling conventions).60
      An example of a PN which has been affected by palatalization is ke-sa-do-ro
/Kessandros/ from /Kesti-andros/ through the intermediary stage /Kestjandros/.
Even within this group there are, however, forms in which palatalization has
failed to take place: for instance *Kasti-ānōr seems to have yielded both ka-sa-no
/Kassānōr/ and ka-ta-no /Kastānōr/ and in the latter the element -t- is preserved,
but -i- is not employed. The dynamics ruling these oscillations are not entirely
clear. In section 7.9 we will consider the solution proposed by García Ramón
(1992), who argues that the coexistence of palatalized and non-palatalized forms
is ruled by rhythmical factors. In summary, therefore, a special phonetic environ-
ment isolates a number of FCs in -ti- (those preceded by -s-) from others.
      For the question of the relation between -ti- and -si- forms the second group
of Mycenaean FCs in -ti- is, on the other hand, of fundamental importance. This
type is characterized by full-grade roots in which the element -ti- is preceded by
a vowel or by [r]: examples are ta-ti-qo-we-u (with a FC /Stāti-/ or /Tāti-/) and
o-ti-na-wo (with the FC /Orti-/). In these phonetic environments, [ti] is free to assi-
bilate, but in the PNs under consideration here it does not. These compounds
are similar to the first-millennium -τι- forms studied by Specht, characterized by
the full grade and the suffix -τι- (βητάρμων, ̓ρτίλοχος etc.). As noted by Specht
(1932), the simple and compounded agent nouns of these verbs mostly show the
same root grade: see compounds in -βητης and -ορτᾱς. My conclusion, however, is
59 According to Méndez Dosuna (1991–1993), this is technically a case of dissimilation: [ti] goes
to [tsi] (affrication), but this affricate dissimilates because of the preceding [s]: the result there-
fore is [sti].

different. While Specht assumes that forms such as βητ- are root nouns employed
in the FC, I submit that FCs in -ti- (and later -si-) are fully verbal: no nominal stem
is involved in their formation.
      There are no evident phonetic reasons that could explain why the Mycenaean
FCs in -ti- of the second group are not assibilated. The situation therefore is very
different from the one just described for the first group, where -ti- may be blocked
by the phonetic environment. In the case of forms belonging to the second group
a morphological explanation may provide a better answer.61 The hypothesis
which the next sections test is that in some FCs [ti] was prevented from assibi-
lating because assibilation would result in similarity with an s-aorist which the
great majority of the verbs behind these FCs did not possess. Moreover, most of
these verbs have the root aorist as their primary formation: the identity between
the root aorist singular stem and the bare root on which these FCs are based may
have further functioned as a kind of blocking. In other words, the tendency to
match compound constituents with live verbal forms may have inhibited assib-
ilation in order to maintain morphological transparency. The analysis provided
in section 7 pursues this hypothesis with insights into the structure and possible
meaning of these Mycenaean FCs in -ti- and their compounds.
      On the question of the Mycenaean PNs with FCs in -si-, they do not neces-
sarily all have to be interpreted as examples of ‘successful’ assibilation of -ti-
which escaped the above-mentioned blocking: rather, four out of five of these
Mycenaean -si- forms can only be understood if they were directly formed on the
s-aorist (ma-na-si-we-ko, qa-sa-ko, qi-si-ja-ko, ta-si-ko-no: see analysis in sections
5.1 and 7.9). Since compounds based on the s-aorist are already attested in Myce-
naean, it is likely that derivation from the s-aorist might also be independent of
assibilation from the start.62
61 Thompson (2008: 758) likewise identifies analogical levelling as the cause behind unassibi-
lated τερψίμβροτος compounds, without however pinpointing the source of this analogy.
62 See Dunkel (1992: 216) and Stefanelli (2008). Stefanelli’s reconstruction differs from mine in
the crucial point of the relationship of the two types with one another. She concludes that only
-si- was used to derive V1 compounds from verbal stems (the s-aorist), while -ti- characterized
FCs formed with agent nouns. Stefanelli (2008: 20) also mentions the fact that West Greek pre-
fers forms in -si- to those in -ti- in order to prove that forms in -si- may not have arisen in Greek
through the assibilation [ti] > [si]. I agree with the second part of this proposition (-si- could be
originally independent of assibilation), but I am more sceptical about her use of the West Greek
evidence. Stefanelli uses the fact that FCs in -ti- are extremely rare in West Greek (where FCs in
-si- are pervasive) to argue that assibilation is not responsible for the rise of -si- compounds. In
my opinion, the first-millennium West Greek evidence is too recent to prove anything about the
origin of these compounds: by the first millennium, compounds in -ti- had ceased to be a produc-
tive pattern, regardless of their origin or geographic distribution.

186            Chapter Four – The Historical Perspective
      The suggested explanation of FCs in -ti- accords a role to the analogical pres-
sure of the root aorist, a formation which is certainly marginal in Classical Greek
and in the extant Linear B tablets, but which may have been more common in
Mycenaean Greek or at the linguistic stage immediately preceding it.63 In the next
sections we will consider the PIE background of the Mycenaean situation, and
attempt to relate the morphology of V1 compounds to the development of the PIE
verbal system. Our focus will concern the morphological or analogical processes
which may be at play in the selection of the verbal roots or stems featuring in
compound constituents.
6 V1 compounds in the context of the PIE verbal system
When linguists propose theoretical models of word formation processes they
often speak of ‘roots’ or ‘stems’, which are abstract notions: but the word forma-
tion rules understood and applied by speakers reflect their knowledge and under-
standing of analogy and paradigmatic regularity rather knowledge and under-
standing of the linguistic concept of ‘stem’.64 Thus, as we have seen in sections
3 and 4, Greek V1 compounds are mostly formed according to a productive set
of derivational rules which enable the creation of verbal compounds from stems
which are synchronically used for the formation of given verbal tenses, most
notably the present, the aorist and the future. It is conceivable that a similar der-
ivational cycle characterized earlier linguistic stages as well, since the type char-
acterized by -e-, which seems inherited, derives directly from thematic radical
present stems.
      Although Greek shows a large number of roots in FCs ending in -e-, what we
can abstract from their variety is that roots which selected the present as their
primary formation—which is signalled by the fact that the present is radical, i.e.
formed without affixes—yield FCs in -e-, while roots which selected the aorist as
their primary formation (again this means the root aorist) yield FCs formed on the
root itself, followed by -ti-. This hypothetical reconstruction accords a paradig-
63 There are only ca. thirty aorist forms in the Linear B tablets, reflecting the verbs which are
most likely to be found in accountancy texts (e.g. δίδωμι, ἵστημι). The root aorist of a number of
them already shows the -κ- suffix, e.g. do-ke /dōke/, te-ke /thēke/: see Bartoněk (2003: 326–327).
64 Nielsen Whitehead (2012: 89–91), an advocate of the stem interpretation of V1 compounds,
counters the idea that stems are only linguistic abstractions, submitting that they are ‘linguis-
tically real’ concepts. She stresses the role of proportional analogy in the speakers’ derivation
of uninflected stems from paradigms and derivational patterns of given forms. I agree with this
view.

matic role to the root present and the root aorist, taken as the most basic verbal
formations.65
      In a widely accepted reconstruction of the PIE verbal system, the root present
and aorist are thought to express a grammatical opposition between the ‘perfec-
tive’ and ‘imperfective’ aspect respectively.66 The choice of which aspect (and
hence which formation) a given root would receive was probably driven by the
inherent lexical aspect of the root. Roots referring to events which are more nat-
urally envisaged as having an end-point (‘telic’ roots), such as ‘give’ or ‘put’,
would preferentially chose the perfective aspect, while those which referred to
events envisaged as not having an end-point (‘atelic’ roots), such as ‘speak’ or
‘go’, would select the imperfective aspect.67 In origin, therefore, the root aorist,
which is already a relic in most IE languages of early attestation, must have been
a very common class.68 It may be noted, however, that the theoretical distinction
between ‘telic’ and ‘atelic’ roots is not always well-matched by the verbal forma-
tions attested in the individual languages.69
      At a second stage, the original primary root present or aorist would be paired
with a secondary formation, created through the use of supplementary formants
(e.g. present affixes such as *-jé/ó- or *-sk ̑é/ó- or reduplication), which would
fill the other slot in this binary system. For instance, the root *deh3- ‘give’ would
select the root aorist as its primary formation, but a secondary present expressing
imperfective aspect later emerged: the fact that the present is a secondary forma-
tion is shown by its reduplicated stem (di-deh3-). The same derivational devices
could be used to create different present formations from the same root, which
conveyed different functions and nuances (Aktionsarten). This polymorphism is
still formally represented in many daughter languages (prominently in Indo-Ira-
nian and Greek).70
65 The root present is reconstructed to have originally been an athematic formation, which was
later often replaced by thematic root presents: see LIV 10, 12. The derivation of compounded
FCs in -e- therefore presupposes that many athematic presents have already been changed into
thematic presents.
66 Champions of this view are e.g. Hoffmann (1970), Cowgill (1975: 563), Erhart (1975), Harđar-
son (1993: 21–22), Sihler (1995: 445). For a typological introduction to aspect, see Comrie (1976).
Strunk (1994: 424, 428) maintains that the opposition only arose after the creation of the s-aorist:
see n. 75 below.

tal bibliography, is Napoli (2006: 45–52).
68 According to the figures in McCullagh (2003: 30), based on LIV, there might have been as
many as 409 different root aorists in PIE.

188          Chapter Four – The Historical Perspective
     What concerns us here is not whether the FC of prototypical V1 compounds
in PIE also expressed aspectual nuances, which would be impossible to prove or
disprove in any case. In principle, it is conceivable that in some cases FCs refer-
ring to a continuous action were derived from a present stem, while those repre-
senting the verbal action in its punctual aspect were characterized by the aorist
stem. However, the evidence from the individual IE languages does not support
the view that aspect played a role in the make-up of compounds at a synchronic
level, so that the hypothesis that this happened in PIE must remain speculative
and ultimately impossible to verify.71 Our concern therefore is purely with the
morphological models which may have influenced the selection of the FCs, not
with the individuation of their aspectual nuances, which would be a purely spec-
ulative exercise.
6.1 The derivation of compound FCs from verbal roots and stems
The derivational system of V1 compounds envisaged here rests on the assumption
that V1 compounds were formed with different stems or roots, sometimes with
the aid of compound markers, in formal association with existing tenses of their
base verbs. Roots which found their appointed formation in the present would be
represented through FCs derived from the present stem, which is marked by the
thematic vowel (we may additionally note that -e- was a very rare linking element
in all other compound categories, and thus a very good candidate for compounds
which were characterized by a distinctly peculiar structure).
     As far as -ti- is concerned, the early Greek evidence allows the hypothesis
that in origin it was a device which marked derivation from roots whose primary
formation was the root aorist. Let us reconsider as an example the root *deh3-
‘give’. Its primary verbal formation is the root aorist *(e)-deh3-, which employs
the simple root, while the reduplicated present *di-deh3- is secondary. Forms such
as Δωτώ (< *Δωτι-) and dti-vara- could therefore use the full-grade root *deh3-
because this characterized the primary formation of the verb ‘to give’. As already
claimed by Specht, it is likely that the compound device -t- was selected on
analogy with other compounds based on full-grade roots, namely V2 compounds
in -t- (type προ-βλη-τ-). In origin, this -t- could have been inserted to aid Kompo-
sitionsfuge when the SC began with a vowel; to the contrary, with FCs beginning
with a consonant the vocalic root was free to remain as it was: an example of this
(1996: 231, 337). Other recent approaches have attempted to integrate the Hittite evidence into
theoretical models of the IE verb: see Jasanoff (2003).
71 Contra, see Andriotis (1938: 96–97).

type would be the Greek compound Τλη-πόλεμος (see section 3) and the Vedic
compound sth-raśman ‘making reins firm’ (section 2.1). At some point, -t- must
have been extended to all FCs, making it necessary to develop another device
to aid Kompositionsfuge before SCs beginning with a consonant: this device is
the element -i-, which in turn seems to have been extended to all V1 FCs of this
kind, of which it became a characteristic marker. In V1 compounds this vowel,
probably imported from the Caland system, does not have any semantic function
and is a mere linking element.72 Through the insertion of the whole -ti- marker,
compounds based on the bare root came be marked against those derived from
the present stem and characterized by -e-.
     In Greek this system was enriched by an important innovation: namely, the
possibility of deriving V1 compounds from the s-aorist. A great incentive to this
derivational process was certainly provided by the independent Greek sound
change creating [si] out of [ti]. However, given the prominent role that the s-aorist
plays in Greek it is likely that an independent derivation of compound FCs from
its stem had started even before assibilation took place. The s-aorist itself is likely
to have been a late addition to the PIE verbal system, but a widespread one.73
Scholars mostly disagree as to whether it developed after Anatolian branched off
or whether this new verbal formation was somehow shared by all IE languages,
becoming productive in some and remaining isolated in others.74 In Greek, the
s-aorist is often opposed to the root aorist, expressing transitivity and causativity,
but other models (among many others) suggest that its function originally was
that of expressing the perfective aspect roots which found their appointed forma-
tion in the present.75 However, we are usually unable to observe such a clear-cut
distribution in the forms attested in the individual daughter languages.
72 Stefanelli (2008: 26, 29) assigns a deeper value to -i-: she argues that in Greek this element
signalled allomorphy (as in Caland compounds and in V1 compounds in -τι-) as well as predi-
cation, marking transitivity (as in V1 compounds in -σι-). On this view see also Bader (1974: 48).
I do not think that these approaches are useful. No other linking element, as far as I can tell, is
endowed with extra functions of this kind: the Greek -ε-, -ο-, -η, -ᾱ- mark derivation from specific
stems or simply serve to aid Kompositionsfuge.

74 See Harđarson (1993: 94, 96), Strunk (1994: 429). Some contributions, adopting Meid’s (1975)
‘Space-Time model’, have attempted to show that the aorist was an areal innovation, which arose
in East PIE: see Schmitt-Brandt (1987) and Drinka (1995). This view is now generally discarded.
75 See Strunk (1994: 429), with partly different terminology: ‘Its [the s-aorist’s] main function
presumably consisted in bestowing perfectivity on durative verbs, so that these could be used in
the sense of a perfective past (aorist)’. According to Strunk, it was only after the appearance of
the s-aorist that ‘a clear-cut aspectual system based on an ubiquitous distinction of present- and
aorist-stems was really established’. This is a corollary of his belief that there was no formal op-
position between the present and the aorist before the creation of the s-aorist, a hypothesis that

      The creation of V1 compounds based on the new s-aorist therefore might have
happened at a very recent stage, when the Greco-Aryan branch, which shares
important innovations in the verbal system, had already broken off; or, in con-
sideration of the fact that such compounds based on the s-aorist are not attested
in Indo-Iranian, it might concern uniquely the early phases of Greek. The above
observations are useful to contextualize the hypothesis that compounds based on
the s-aorist could have existed already before the constitution of Proto-Greek, but
they cannot be considered conclusive evidence in that direction.
      In Greek, the new compounds based on the s-aorist kept their stem, with the
characteristic s-suffix.76 In this respect, the fate of this -s- is similar to that of other
suffixes which are used in compounding in association with certain stems, but
are also adopted as linking elements and as such exported to other FCs. A good
example is -o-, the suffix which characterizes o-stems but is also extended to first-
and third-declension stems where it has the function of a mere linking vowel.
In FCs in -ti- and in -si- the -i- element, devoid of any semantic role, is another
simple linking element. This is shown by the fact that, as noted in section 4.1, the
element -si- can also be attached to stems which do not have a sigmatic aorist,
such as φυξι- from φεύγω, or φερε-σι- from φερω-.
7 Mycenaean compounds as an intermediary stage
The Mycenaean evidence describes a stage in which -ti- compounds have already
started coexisting with, and in some cases being replaced by, -si- compounds.
As argued, this replacement was swifter when the assibilated FC could be for-
mally likened to existing s-aorists; conversely, the lack of an s-aorist may have
been responsible for the preservation of some FCs in -ti- as such. In the sections
below we will see that many of the roots behind FCs in -ti- show evidence of
having selected the root aorist as their primary formation, while the present or
other aorist formations are often clearly more recent additions: the existence of
‘live’ root aorists versus the lack of s-aorists could therefore be identified as the
analogical conditioning factor behind the lack of assibilation. After this period,
alphabetic Greek generalized a two-fold system of V1 compounds based on
is not followed here. The debate over the original function (and hence origin) of the s-aorist is
vast: see Szemerényi (1996: 281–284), Napoli (2006: 48 n. 23), Dunkel (2010) for references.
76 The origin of the aorist marker -s- is debated. Watkins (1969b: 97–106) maintained that it
derived from a third ps. sg. ending -s and that it originally signalled a ‘basically neutral, intransi-
tive value of the sigmatic aorist in its earlier manifestations’ (1969b: 103), simply predicating ‘the
existence of a verbal action’ (1969b: 104).

the opposition between the present and the s-aorist stems, the φερέοικος and
τερψίμβροτος types, with the later addition of the rare and analogical type based
on the thematic aorist (e.g. compounds in λιπο-). We will begin the analysis of
Mycenaean V1 compounds from those in which -ti- may be blocked precisely by
these conditioning factors, followed by compounds in which -ti- is preceded by
[s] and may have been blocked primarily by phonological factors (the first group
described in section 5.1).
7.1 V1 compounds from *h2er-
Compound                         Likely transcription                        FC
a-ti-pa-mo                       /Artiphāmos/                                ar-ti- < √*h2er-
The PN a-ti-pa-mo, which has four secure attestations in the Knossos and
Pylos tablets and two more doubtful attestations, is usually interpreted as
/Antiphāmos/.77 However, a derivation from *h2er-, the root behind ἀραρ́σκω ‘fit
together’, is equally possible.78 In Greek, the simple root ἀρ- characterizes two
verbal formations: the middle participle ἄρμενος ‘fit, appropriate’ (Hom.) and a
few compounds in -άρτης, the oldest of which is πυλάρτης ‘gate-fastener’ (Hom.).
ἄρμενος is the only relic of the old root aorist: it is based on the zero grade of
the root (*h2r-) which in Greek yields the same outcome as the full grade *h2er-:
ἀρ-. This root aorist was the primary formation of the root, while the present
ἀραρ́σκω, showing two derivational markers (reduplication and the -σκ- suffix)
is clearly a secondary formation.
     The FC based on the root ar-, followed by -ti-, could therefore be supported
by a verbal formation, the root aorist, in which the same root featured without
the addition of suffixes. Already in Homeric Greek the root aorist of *h2er- coex-
ists with two other formations: the reduplicated thematic aorist ἤραρον, probably
built on the zero-grade forms of the root aorist;79 and the s-aorist ἤρσα, attested
already in Homer.80 It is conceivable that the root aorist was still in use in Myce-
77 See DMic s.v.
78 Waanders (2008: 17).
79 The debate over whether the original ablaut pattern of the PIE root aorist was based on the
opposition between the full grade of the singular/dual and the zero grade of the plural has no
relevance for the present discussion, since compound FCs would be based on the root grade
of the singular anyway. On this issue, see Harđarson (1993: 90–93, 150–152), McCullagh (2002:
60–62) (both for the original ablaut distinction); contra, Malzahn (2004), with a review of previ-
ous theories that go in this direction.

naean, providing a paradigmatic form to which FCs in /arti/ could be linked,
resisting assibilation into /arsi/. The latter FC may be attested in later compounds
such as Ἀρσίνοος (Hom.), perhaps to be interpreted as ‘he who is steady in his
mind’.81
     The interpretation of a-ti-pa-mo as /Artiphāmos/ ‘he who fits together words’
or ‘he who fits together prophetic sayings’ is encouraged by the alphabetic epithet
ἀρτιεπής ‘good at talking’ as well. Its FC is usually connected to ἄρτιος ‘quick’,
but a derivation from *h2er- is not only equally possible, but also preferable on
morphological grounds.82 If the FC ἀρτι- derived from ἄρτιος, the lack of the the-
matic vowel would be odd: in order to explain it, Knecht (1946: 17) has to suppose
that ἀρτι- originally derived from the adverb ἄρτι ‘just’ and that the FC was only
secondarily connected to ἀραρίσκω, under the influence of ̓ρτίλοχος. It is more
probable that old compounds in ἀρτι- based on the root *h2er- were semantically
re-interpreted when compounds with FCs in -ti- had become extinct. This is par-
ticularly probable in the case of ἀραρίσκω, a verb characterized by a very low
number of derivations, most of which are likely to have been obscure to speakers
(Chapter 6, section 3.2).

These three Mycenaean PNs have been linked to the root *h3er-, giving rise to
the Greek present ὄρνυμι.83 The most transparent is o-ti-na-wo /Ortināwos/ (PY
Cn 285), while the interpretation of e-ti-me-de-i and e-ti-ra-wo is more dubious.
Among the interpretations which have been suggested, the most common view sees
their FCs as corresponding to the SC of the PN Λαέρτᾱς: this yields /Ertimēdehi/
and /Ertilāwos/. The existence of various by-forms of ὄρνυμι with initial [e], includ-
ing the glosses ἔρετο, ἔρσεο and ἔρσͅ in Hesychius, is problematic: the different

vocalism has been explained either as a form of secondary ablaut or as analogical
on the root *h1er- (ἔρχομαι), but the question remains open.84
     According to the derivational model hypothesized here, compounds based on
*h3er- preferentially selected FCs formed on the bare root followed by -ti- rather
than those characterized by -e-: the latter would yield a form (**ὀρ-ε-) which
could not be identified with the present stem (ὀρ-νυ-). Formal similarity of this
FC with the root aorist, which survives in Vedic, Avestan, Armenian, Tocharian B
and Greek, may have played a role in supporting and eventually blocking these
FCs in -ti-, particularly since this was the primary formation from this root.85 In
Greek the old root aorist only survives in a few middle forms, conveying intransi-
tive semantics (͂ρτο ‘he sprang’, ὄρμενος ‘rushing’ and ὄρσο ‘arise!’). All these
forms are built on the zero grade of the root, *h3r-, whose outcome in Greek is
identical to that of the full grade *h3er-, ὀρ- (for a similar situation, compare the
outcomes of *h2er- discussed in section 7.1). The new sigmatic aorist ͂ρσα, on the
other hand, reflects the full grade of the root preceded by the augment.86
     It is necessary to clarify that I am not positing a direct derivation from the root
aorist and its meaning: the FC, here and elsewhere, reflects the inherent semantics
of the root. First-millennium compounds such as Λαέρτας and Λαόρτας are likely
to have a transitive-causative meaning: ‘he who makes the people/army start’.
Similarly, o-ti-na-wo could then be ‘he who makes ships start’, e-ti-ra-wo could be
‘he makes the army start’ and e-ti-me-de could be ‘he who stirs thoughts’.87 Alter-
natively, the first two could also express the intransitive semantics of the middle
(as attested in the extant root aorist forms): ‘he who rushes onto the ship’ and ‘he
who rushes upon the army/enemy’.88
84 The forms showing [e] are discussed by García Ramón (2002: 186), who explains the different
reflexes in Greek as ‘Ablautvarianten’, and EDG, which is in favour of Greek analogical interfer-
ence. See also Harđarson (1993: 200).

the Vedic present íyarti, to suffixes in the Latin present orior (*-jé/ó-) and in the Greek ὄρνυμι

87 On this interpretation of o-ti-na-wo, see Neumann (1994b: 643). On the Mycenaean names in

SC -μήδης is predeced by a verbal FC.

7.3 V1 compounds from *steh2- (or *teh2-)
Compound                      Likely transcription                       FC
ta-ta-ke-u                    /Stātarkhēus/                              stā-t(i)- < √*steh2-

    /Tātigwōwēus/             tā-ti- < √*teh2-
On phonological grounds, these two PNs can be interpreted as containing either
the root *steh2- ‘stand, make stand’ or the root *teh2- ‘steal’.89 The first interpre-
tation is more likely in that *steh2- builds a very common verb in Greek, ἵστημι;
the reflexes of *teh2- on the other hand are very rare outside Hittite, Vedic and
Archaic Latin.90
     Although the Linear B script does not allow us to securely interpret the length
of the first vowel in these two forms, the consensus is to interpret this vowel as
[a:], deriving from the full grade of the root. /stā/ would therefore be selected to
form the FC of V1 compounds, possibly at a stage in which the root had not yet
built an s-aorist and its primary formation was the root aorist (ἔστην). The redu-
plicated athematic present represented in Greek by ἵστημι is a clearly secondary
formation: it covers both the transitive meanings of the root (in the active voice)
and the intransitive meanings (in the middle). At a later stage, Greek added the
s-aorist ἔστησα, an innovation shared only by Old Avestan and specialized for
the expression of transitive-causative semantics (‘make stand, place, set up’).
V1 compounds based on the stem of the s-aorist στησ- are a common enough
type in Greek (see the Corpus). This is probably attributable to both morpholog-
ical and semantic reasons: the s-aorist is a very frequent form of ἵστημι and its
transitive-causative semantics makes it particularly appropriate for the basic V1
pattern, with the SC expressing the role of the object. There are no compounds
based on the simple root στᾱ-/στη- in first-millennium Greek.
     According to this interpretation, both Mycenaean PNs therefore preserved
an older compound type, based on the simple root, but already in Mycenaean
the new type based on the stem of the s-aorist emerged alongside this old type.
The semantics of ta-ti-qo-we-u, if it is to be interpreted as /Stātigwōwēus/, can
be clarified on the basis of the later compound Στήσιππος, identifying a person
who restrains horses:91 ta-ti-qo-we-u would thus be ‘he who makes cattle stand’.
ta-ta-ke-u is more obscure, though it has been suggested that the SC derives from

‘he divided his dominions’ (Hdt. 3.89.1).92 For the correlation between these com-
pounds in ta-ti- and the PN ta-si-ko-no, built on the s-aorist, see section 7.10. As
noted, a derivation of the FC of these compounds from *teh2- is less likely, since
this root builds no verb in Greek. The advantage of supposing this derivation is
that ta-ti-qo-we-u (but not ta-ta-ke-u) would yield a very good meaning, identify-
ing ‘he who steals cattle’.93

?]ke-ti-ra-wo          ?/Kestilāwos/       kes-ti- < √* k ̑ens-
We now come to the FCs in -ti- introduced in section 5.1, in which -ti- is preceded
by [s] and where therefore the preservation of [ti] is phonologically conditioned.
The first of the FCs in question are forms in ke-ti- /Kesti-/ which are likely to reflect
the root * k ̑ens- ‘give solemnly a piece of advice’, continued in Vedic śáṁsati and
Latin censēo, but lost in Greek. The FC * k ̑ens-ti-, yielding *kes-ti- in Greek, is likely
to be preserved in the form ]ke-ti-ra-wo, probably to be interpreted as a PN, which
occurs only once on tablet KN V 7049.94 In DMic the only hypothetical interpre-
tation of this name is /Akestilāwos/, with the FC deriving from ἀκέομαι, yielding
the meaning ‘healer of the people’ (cf. ἀκεστήρ ‘healer’). However, this interpre-
tation runs counter to everything we know about the use of the -ti- element in
Greek, which is never found attached to denominative verbs. The interpretation
as /Kes-ti-lāwos/ ‘who speaks solemnly to his people/army’, from the root * k ̑ens-
‘give solemnly a piece of advice’ is preferable, since it is also supported by the
existence of the Kurzname ke-ti-ro /Kesti-los/.
      As posited in 5.1, FCs containing the cluster [sti] tend to undergo palataliza-
tion before a short vowel: thus, *kes-ti-andros yields Kessandros (ke-sa-do-ro) and
*kes-ti-andrā yields Kessandrā (ke-sa-da-ra) (‘s/he who speaks authoritatively to
men’). In ke-ti-ro /Kestilos/ and ]ke-ti-ra-wo /Kestilāwos/, on the other hand, [sti]
is blocked because it is followed by a consonant. Precisely because there are no

it is not possible to decide whether or not another sign preceded it, the name may well be pre-
served entirely.

The PN ka-ta-no (to be kept distinct from the toponym attested on KN X 795) is
often interpreted as containing the FC /kast-/ < *kad-t(i)- < *kȇ n̥d-ti, which proba-
bly also features in the PN Καστιάνειρα.96 The IE root *kȇ nd- ‘stand out’ (perhaps
originally ‘be visible’) seems to have built perfect forms as its primary formations:
a good parallel of the Greek perfect κέκασμαι ‘to excel’ is the Vedic perfect śāśad-
‘to distinguish oneself’.97 The Greek middle perfect continues the zero grade
of the root, *kn   ̑ ̥d-, which is also employed in the FC /kast(i)/ (cf. also Κάστωρ),
clearly based on the only root grade continued in Greek.98 Here -i- is not employed
before the SC beginning with a vowel: as noted, this may be reconstructed as
the original situation for V1 FCs based on bare roots, in which only the element
-t- was used, while -i- was introduced only before consonantal SC. We may also
wonder whether the third ps. of the perfect, κέκασται, exercized some kind of
analogical pressure on the FC. On the other hand, palatalization has regularly
occurred in Κασσ́νδρα < /Kasti-andrā/ (not to be confused with Κε(σ)σ́νδρα,
see 7.4); the meaning of these Greek names could be ‘he/she who distinguishes
himself among men’.

that the original meaning of Καστιάνειρα was ‘adornment of men’ (‘Schmuck, Auszeichnung der
Männer’) and was later taken to signify ‘she who adorns men’. This semantic and syntactic analy-
sis leads him to interpret the FC as ‘eigentlich ein Abstractum [...], das im Laufe einer bestimmten
Entwicklung auf den Aorist bezogen wurde’. The same root is probably contained in the short
name ka-te-u /Kastēus/ and in ka-to /Kastōr/.
97 On the original meaning of the root, see García Ramón (1992: 242); contra, LIV 351 n. 1 which,

Compound                      Likely transcription                         FC
me-ti-ja-no                   /Mēstiānōr/                                  mēs-ti- < √*mēd-
This is another compound in [sti] that does not undergo palatalization before the
vocalic SC. Among the reasons for this lack of palatalization there might perhaps
be the fact that the resulting FC /Mēss-/ would not correspond to any form of
the Greek verbs built by the ablauting root *mēd-/*med-, which give rise to the
thematic presents μ́δομαι ‘plan’ and μέδομαι ‘devise’.99 These are thought to be
Greek secondary creations from originally athematic present formations.100
     The same root gives rise to a sigmatic aorist in Avestan and in Greek
(ἐμήσατο), which LIV 423 regards as the original aorist formation. However, the
gloss μῆστο· ἐβουλεύσατο in Hesychius makes the case for the existence of an old
root aorist. μῆστο is interpreted as an old athematic imperfect by Chantraine in
DELG, an interpretation which is considered possible in LIV 423 (‘viell.[eicht]’),
but it is also probable that this is the only relic of the full-grade middle root aorist
(so LSJ): Hesychius’ interpretamentum ἐβουλεύσατο (another aorist) may point in
this direction. This middle therefore may have analogically generalized the full
grade: this is not a unique case in the Greek paradigm, where the middle μήδομαι
also may have been an analogical innovation.101
     In the creation of compounds from μ́δομαι the simple root *mēd- was selected
because the thematic radical present is a secondary formation and, therefore, the
FC /mēde-/ was perhaps not possible: once the simple root /mēd-/ was selected,
it was enlarged with the linking element -ti-. The meaning of /Mēstiānōr/ could
be ‘he who takes care of men’.102

The interpretation of this PN as /Nestiānōr/, from the root *nes- ‘survive, escape
danger’ is almost unanimous: it is thought to mean ‘he who leads his men back’,

saving them.103 Again, the cluster [sti] does not palatalize before the vocalic SC,
just as in /Mēstiānōr/ above: in both cases, this lack of palatalization may be due
to the fact that the -ti- syllable is both preceded and followed by heavy syllables
(-nes-/mēs- and -ān-). That palatalization is likely to have happened at a much
later stage, in the Theassalian PN Νέσσανδρος,104 is not a counterargument: at
this later stage, no new V1 compounds with FCs in -ti- are created and all forms
have been levelled out by assibilation or palatalization to comply with the τερ-
ψίμβροτος type.
      The root *nes- in Greek yields the thematic radical present νέομαι ‘to go back,
to return’. This present is a secondary formation, since the oldest forms of the
root point towards a root aorist: see the Vedic first ps. optative (sám) nasīmahi
(RV 2.16.8) ‘may we be united’ and the middle participle ἄσμενος ‘escaped’ (e.g. Il.
20.350), from the zero grade *n̥s-.105 As in other cases, the original root aorist was
later replaced by an s-aorist, which survives (preceded by ἀπό) in a few relics: the
middle (with intransitive meaning) ἀπεν́σσατο ‘he had gone back’ (e.g. Il. 2.629)
and the active subjunctive (with transitive-causative semantics) ἀπον́σσωσιν
‘they may send back’ (Il. 16.86). The [a] vowel in the stem of this s-aorist cannot
be explained as a regular reflex of the full grade *nes-, and must be interpreted
as continuing the vocalic grade of the middle (< *n̥s-), which seems to have been
the only productive form in first-millennium Greek.106 Because of the poor trans-
parency of the s-aorist stem νασσ-, Greek replaces this aorist with the suppletive
form ἐνόστησα, from the denominative νοστέω ‘to come home’, a more common
verb than the mostly poetic νέομαι.107
      *nes- is the only root for which Mycenaean provides evidence of the parallel
creation of a φερέοικος-type compound, ne-e-ra-wo /Nehelāwōi/ (dat.), which
points to the fact that the present νέομαι was already in use at this early linguis-
tic stage ([s] goes to [h] in intervocalic position).108 The semantics of this name

105 LIV 454. Τhe preservation of the cluster [sm] in ἄσμενος is a problem, since this is always lost
in intervocalic position. For this reason, Wackernagel argued that the participle derived from an
s-aorist (*n̥s-s-menos), but LIV 455 n. 3 suggests that in the participle [s] may have been triggered
by analogy with the forms of the verb in which [s] preceded other consonants, for instance *asto
< *n̥s-to.
106 Τhe connection of these forms with νάω ‘to live’, proposed by LSJ, is secondary and
etymologically difficult: see García Ramón (2004: 34, 36), Kölligan (2007: 373–375).

7.8 V1 compounds from *sweh2d-
Compound                        Likely transcription                      FC
wa-ti-ko-ro                     /Wāstikhoros/                             wās-ti- < √*sweh2d-
This PN is usually interpreted to be the only Mycenaean form containing the
root behind the Greek verb ἥδομαι ‘to take pleasure in’; its meaning is transpar-
ent: ‘he who takes pleasure in dance’. The same root may also be attested in the
Kurzname ]wa-ti-ro, on which see below.110 The radical present ἥδομαι is likely
to be a secondary formation in Greek, as is the Vedic -jé/ó- present sūdáyati ‘he
makes delicious’ (RV 3.4.10, etc.).111 The primary formation seems to have been
the root aorist: this is argued on the basis of the thematic aorist third person
indicative forms εὔαδε and ἅδε ‘he took pleasure in’, which are based on the zero-
grade forms of the root aorist.112 The old root aorist corresponding to ἥδομαι was
replaced by a new s-aorist, already attested in Homer with the form ἥσατο ‘he
enjoyed’. The thematic aorist characterized by [a] in turn provided the basis for a
new Greek present, ἁνδάνω (which is post-Homeric).
     The FC of /wāsti/ therefore results from the full-grade root *sweh2d-, which
characterized the old root aorist and the radical present ἥδομαι. [sti] is preserved
since it is followed by a consonant. The fact that the FC is not wa-de /wāde-/
shows that the compound was built on the simple root, not on the present stem
and implicitly confirms the tendency to employ FCs in -ti- when the primary for-
mation of a given root is not the present.
7.9 The system of V1 compounds in Mycenaean
The above sections have considered the likely interpretation and etymology of the
Mycenaean PNs characterized by a FC ending in -ti. I have endeavoured to prove
that in all these cases the element -ti- was blocked by several factors. In the cases

200            Chapter Four – The Historical Perspective
in which [ti] would be free to assibilate (i.e. when it is preceded by a vowel or [r]),
its blocking arguably has a morphological reason: namely, the fact that the result-
ing assibilated FC could not be linked to an s-aorist. [ti] is therefore kept to pre-
serve transparency of the root. In these cases, we have noted a correlation with
the fact that both the present and the s-aorist of these roots are secondary for-
mations, while their root aorist (still attested in Greek) is the primary formation.
This explanation—which assumes that the root aorist could have exercised an
analogical pressure on the shape of certain compound FCs—is not meant to imply
that these FCs are actively formed on the root aorist stem, or that they reflect the
specific semantics of this tense. Although defining the semantics of onomastic
forms, particularly in the case of Mycenaean, is a slippery path, in a number of
cases it has been possible to envisage likely meanings, which are compatible with
the semantics of the given roots in Greek but not specifically with that of the root
aorist.
     In a second group of FCs—in which [ti] is preceded by [s]—its ability to pal-
atalize is mostly dependent on the phonetic environment: namely, whether or
not it is followed by a vowel. If we look at competing pairs, collected in Table 4.4
(nos. 1–3) below, we see that some oscillations are regularly conditioned by pho-
nology.

                                 7 Mycenaean compounds as an intermediary stage               201
In ke-ti-ro /Kestilos/, [sti] does not palatalize because it is not followed by a vowel,
while in ke-sa-do-ro /Kessandros/ and ke-sa-da-ra /Kessandrā/ [sti] palatalizes
because it is followed by a vowel. However, the same palatalization does not
occur in me-ti-ja-no (7.6) and ne-ti-ja-no (7.7), although here [sti] is also followed
by a vowel. I have suggested that these cases could have been treated differently
from those of ke-sa-do-ro /Kessandros/ and ke-sa-da-ra /Kessandrā/ because
in me-ti-ja-no and ne-ti-ja-no [sti] is followed by a long vowel, while in */Kesti-
andros/ and /Kesti-andrā/, yielding /Kessandros/ and /Kessandrā/, the following
vowel is short. However, along the same lines one would expect the [sti] of /Kasti-
ānōr/, which is equally followed by [a:], to be blocked but, instead, in one case it
palatalizes, yielding ka-sa-no /Kassānōr/.
     It is clear therefore that the phonological factors triggering or blocking
palatalization are of a more complex nature and may perhaps vary according
to the type of root contained in the FC. Regarding the coexistence of ka-ta-no /
Kastānōr/ (with first-millennium Greek Καστιάνειρα) and ka-sa-no /Kassānōr/,
García Ramón (1992) argues that the oscillations are due to rhythmical condition-
ing factors, of a similar nature to those ruling word-external sandhi.114 The same
oscillations appear to concern wa-ti-ro /Wāstilos/ and wa-si-ro /Wāssilos/ as well:
in the latter, palatalization occurs even though the SC of the original compound
(arguably, /Wāsti-lāwos/) begins with a consonant, in opposition to the treatment
of wa-ti-ro, as well as that of ke-ti-ro discussed above.
     Table 4.4 shows that there is only one pair in which the coexistence of FCs
in -ti- and in -si- may be ascribed to assibilation (no. 4). However, assuming that
both ta-ti- and ta-si- derive from *steh2-, assibilation is not the only possible
explanation for the alternation of [ti] and [si] in the FC: ta-si could derive directly
from the s-aorist stem στησ-, thus representing a parallel type of compound to
those derived from the simple root. The other Mycenaean V1 compounds in -si-
which do not have parallel -ti- forms demonstrate that the derivation from the
s-aorist was a fait accompli in Mycenaean times, since all of them are unequivo-
cally derived from productive Greek s-aorists (refer to Table 4.3). ma-na-si-we-ko
corresponds to ἐμνησάμην, which is among the oldest formations from the root
*mneh2-.115 qa-sa-ko /Kwāsarkhos/ is likely to contain the s-aorist of π́ομαι (a verb
which in first-millennium Greek mostly survives in Doric varieties). qi-si-ja-ko
/Kwīsiarkhos/ seems to reflect the s-aorist of τίνω (ἔτεισα, ἔτῑσα), which would
114 García Ramón (1992: 254).
115 LIV 447 identifies the primary formation of this root with an athematic radical present: in
Greek, this was remade into the thematic present μνάομαι. The s-aorist is the only aorist which
LIV reconstructs from this root: although secondary, it is the oldest form continued in Greek.

therefore be attested already in Mycenaean.116 All these forms in -si- therefore
provide strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that compounds in -si-
could be derived from the s-aorist independently of, and even prior to, assibila-
tion. In parallel with this, it is precisely the fact that we have only one pair of FCs
alternating between [ti] and [si] that shows that the indiscriminate replacement
of -ti- forms with those in -si- was not heavily underway in Mycenaean, and that
there was not widespread confusion and overlap between the two patterns: to the
contrary, the derivational mechanisms of FCs in -ti- and FCs in -si- were kept quite
separate.
7.10 Summary
The conclusion that can be drawn from these data is straightforward. Mycenaean
preserves a stage in which FCs in -ti- have not started being replaced indiscrim-
inately by those in -si-. The [ti] in these FCs may have been blocked to maintain
the root employed in them clear, perhaps under the analogical influence of root
aorist formations. On the other hand, transparent FCs in -si- are mostly linked to
s-aorists and—with the sole exception of compounds in ta-si- emerging alongside
those in ta-ti—there is no single case of coexistence of FCs in -ti- and FCs con-
taining sibilants which can be exclusively explained through assibilation. Rather,
the sibilants in these alternating FCs, which are often geminates, are explainable
within the specific phonetic environment of the compounds.117
      Mycenaean may thus point to the co-existence of two originally independent
types whose overlap has only started to take place. If the wholesale replacement
of -ti- forms with -si- forms—based on assibilation and morphological association
with the s-aorist—had already started in Mycenaean, we would expect a heavier
116 On the [i:] in the stem of the s-aorist ἔτῑσα, already attested in Homer, see Cassio (1991–1993:
199–200). Lejeune (1971: 305 n. 55) to the contrary reconstructs the aorist *ἔτεια from *tei-, formed
in the same way as ἔχευα from *gheu-. This hypothesis is mentioned, without definitive endorse-
ment, in DEG 1121 (τίνω). Such an interpretation finds support in the participle qe-ja-me-no
/kweiamenos/, usually considered to be an aorist participle from τίνω, which does not show [s].
However, the hypothesis that this form continues an old root aorist, though suggested by influen-
tial scholars, for instance Lejeune and Chantraine, is not widely accepted. On this theory, see LIV
380 n. 7 and DMic s.v. qe-ja-me-no, with references. Conversely, the alternative hypothesis that
qe-ja-me-no represents /kweihamenos/ after intervocalic [s] has gone to [h] is in contrast with the
behaviour of the other forms of the s-aorist in Mycenaean (e-ra-se = ἔλασε and e-re-u-te-ro-se =
ἐλευθέρωσε), which preserve the [s]. On [s] > [h] in Mycenaean, see now Morpurgo Davies (2012:
105–107), with bibliography.
117 As noted, *kn  ̑ ̥d- is only continued in the perfect κέκασμαι, while *kȇ ns- was lost and replaced
with ἐπαινέω: see García Ramón (1992: 249).

interchange between the two categories. There should be more -si- forms from the
same verbal roots as those in -ti- and, moreover, we should expect the extension
of -si- also to those FCs which cannot be linked to an s-aorist. On the contrary,
the coexistence of ta-si- and -ta-ti- provides very good evidence in favour of the
fact that the replacement of -ti- with -si- started in the compounds from verbs in
which the coexistence of the old root aorist (ἔστην) and a newer s-aorist (ἔστησα)
is likely to have been in place already at the chronological stage of Mycenaean. In
the absence of s-aorists, some forms in -ti- were precisely preserved because no
‘updating’ to the -si- type was possible.
8 Compounds in -ti- in early alphabetic Greek
Early Greek preserves a surprisingly small number of compounds in -τι-: the PNs
̓ρτ́λοχος, Καστιάνειρα and Δωτώ (< *Δωτι-), and the appellatives βητ́ρμων,
βωτιάνειρα, ἀρτιεπής, ἀρτίπους and ἀρτίφρων. This shows that the replacement
or ‘updating’ of FCs in -ti- to those in -si- was already accomplished by the time
the Homeric poems received their final form. The traditional explanation of these
FCs in -τι- is that they are relics, preserved by the literary prestige of the Aeolic
non-assibilating varieties.118 However, the epigraphic evidence does not support
this hypothesis at all: there is no special incidence of compounds in -τι- from
West Greek areas, where -σι- forms are as common as in East Greek.119 This sug-
gests that the preservation of -τι- is due to other factors.
      As claimed in the previous sections, forms in -τι- were mostly preserved when
their replacement with forms in -σι- was not encouraged by the existence of sig-
matic tenses. This was often accompanied by another phenomenon, namely the
fact that some of the roots on which these FCs were based had become exinct or
rare in Greek. At the same time, conservatism may have decreed the preservation
118 See, e.g. Schwyzer (1939: 442), Risch (1974: 192), Janko (1992: 17), Waanders (2008: 17 n. 32),
but the opinion is widespread.
119 As a matter of fact, there are no straightforward compounded PNs containing -τι- other
than ̓ρτ́λοχος and (perhaps) the Cretan name  ̔Ερπετίδᾱμος; on the latter, see Chapter 5 sec-
tion 4.2. The evidence from short names is not very helpful, chiefly because forms containing
-τ(ι)- and which can be connected to verbal roots are often liable to be interpreted in various
ways: for example, are short names in  ̓Ερατ- relics of the unassibilated  ̓Ερατι- (corresponding
to V1 compounds in  ̓Ερασι-) or abbreviations of compounds beginning with  ̓Ερατo-? Among the
most likely candidates for the preservation of -τι- in the onomastic lexicon it is worth mentioning
 ̓Εγρετίων (Arcadia 425–385 BC) for the fact that it is attested in a dialectal area which underwent
the assibilation of [ti] into [si]: if this form is authentically Arcadian, it proves that the preserva-
tion of -τι- has nothing to do with non-assibilation.

of some -τι- forms in face of the existence of new -σι- forms, particularly in the
case of PNs: this explanation for instance may well apply to ̓ρτ́λοχος vis-à-vis
the recent form ̓ρσ́λοχος, as argued below.120
8.1 ̓ρτ́λοχος
This name follows the formation pattern of the Mycenaean PNs analysed in
section 7.2: its FC contains the bare root behind ὄρνυμι; its meaning is quite trans-
parently ‘he who stirs the ambush’. FCs from this verb prove particularly useful
for the study of the evolution from -ti- to -si- FCs. The only compounds attested
in Mycenaean are of the -ti- type and belong to a stage which precedes the for-
mation of the popular group of compounds based on the s-aorist ͂ρσα, those in
ὀρσι-. The co-existence of ὀρτι- and ὀρσι- in Homeric Greek would thus represent
a similar situation to that represented by the coexistence of forms in ta-ti- and
ta-si- in Mycenaean (see sections 7.3 and 7.9): forms in ὀρτι- are relics, while those
in ὀρσι- are on the way to becoming the only pattern.
8.2 Δωτώ
The Kurzname Δωτώ, the name of a Nereid, derives from a V1 compound in *Δωτι-
through the feminine suffix -ώ, frequent in hypocoristics. The FC contains the
full-grade root δω- < *deh3-, whose use in the FC of compounds may originally
have been supported by the root aorist (e.g. ἔδομεν, δότε), the primary formation
from this root. Δωτώ is blocked in that it is a short form, going back to a FC which
had not undergone assibilation into δωσι-. It is interesting to note that there are
no such FCs from δίδωμι before the fifth century BC and even after this date the
type is very limited, in spite of the importance of the verb itself: this can probably
be explained by the fact that the productive aorist of δίδωμι is the new kappatic
aorist ἔδωκα and there is no sigmatic aorist which could support the extensive
use of the FC δωσι- (which therefore probably employs the future stem).
8.3 βητ́ρμων
The Homeric compound βητ́ρμων, usually glossed as ‘dancer’, probably indi-
cated a special kind of acrobat, who was able to step (βῆναι) onto wheels (cf. Myc.
120 See e.g. Risch (1974: 191), but the interpreation is widespread.

a-mo, yielding the plural ἅρμα ‘chariots’ in alphabetic Greek).121 This meaning
suggests that the connection between the root in the FC and the root aorist ἔβην
could have functioned as an obstacle of assibilation: although the causative s-ao-
rist ἔβησα ‘make go’ was available, re-analysis of the FC into βησ- did not take
place, perhaps because the semantics of the FC βησ- would be different (moreo-
ver, βησι- features in only one V1 compound, the Homeric PN Ἀναβησίλεως).
8.4 βωτίνειρα
This Homeric form has stirred an endless debate and at times has been used to
claim that the FC of -τι- forms hides an old agent noun. The interpretation of the
FC as an agent noun was prompted by the fact that βωτι- does not correspond
to any form of βόσκω ‘feed’, but rather resembles the agent noun βώτωρ and V2
compounds in -βωτης. We will now consider a different interpretation.
     The root behind βόσκω is a matter of debate, but it is probably to be recon-
structed as *gweh3-.122 βόσκω is a *-sk ̑é/ó- present showing the expected zero grade
of this root: *gweh- (*gwh3- > *gwo-, going to βο- in first-millennium Greek). This
present is ancient and has influenced the rest of the paradigm, which extraor-
dinarily preserves the -σκ- suffix in all tenses: the future is βοσκήσω (Hom.), the
aorist is ἐβόσκησα (Geoponica) and the perfect is βεβόσκηκα (Libanius). The
extension of the present suffix to the whole paradigm is a very isolated fact in
Greek: it is the result of an analogical levelling that must have started early on,
as the Homeric future βοσκήσω testifies. The agent noun βοσκός ‘herdsman’, first
attested as a simplex in Aesop,123 further strengthens the impression that the
suffix -σκ- was perceived to be part of the root.
121 See Risch (1974: 52), though he considers this interpretation with caution, and Stefanelli
(2008: 23). Previous analyses have interpreted the FC βητ(ι)- to cover for an agent noun or an
action noun, but the structure of the compound would be extremely artificial. According to Janda
(2000: 28), who subscribes to Schindler’s idea that V1 compounds developed out of bahuvrihis
with a factitive understanding of the FC, the FC would contain an old action noun: βητάρμων
would mean ‘having a running wheel’ and was later interpreted as ‘he who makes the wheel
run’. Janda’s interpretation is followed by Nielsen Whitehead (2012: 74–75), who however does
not discard the hypothesis that the compound is an artificial formation.
122 Lubotsky (1990: 133–134), EDG 223; the root is strangely not included in LIV, which never
quotes βόσκω and its derivations. The idea that the root contained a -w appendix, maintained in
DEG and IEW, derives from the form of the Lithuanian noun gaujà ‘herd’. It is possible, however,
that the Lithuanian noun got its [w] from contamination with the root for ‘cow’, if this is to be
reconstructed as *gweh3-w- (though see contra De Decker (2011)).
123 But see the compounds πορνοβοσκός already in Myrtilus and Demosthenes.

206          Chapter Four – The Historical Perspective
     The full root grade βω- must be part of the original paradigm of βόσκω, given
that it features in its agent noun βώτωρ and in -βωτης compounds, the long vowel
of which would otherwise be difficult to explain. βωτιάνειρα, βώτωρ, etc. could
therefore continue the full-grade root which is likely to have had its appointed
primary formation in a root aorist, later replaced by βόσκω and its paradigm. The
hypothesis that there existed in Greek a root aorist in βω- is further strengthened
by the fact, worth stressing, that ἐβόσκησα and related forms are not attested
before a rather late period.124 βωτιάνειρα, an isolated form, may have been pre-
served because there was no s-aorist **βωσ- and, therefore, there was no verbal
form which could support the change of the FC into βωσι-.125
8.5 Καστιάνειρα
Knecht (1946: 11) considers the PN Καστιάνειρα to follow the same pattern as
βωτιάνειρα. Although never openly stated in his monograph, the resulting belief
is that Καστιάνειρα is a partly artificial form.126 The Mycenaean evidence dis-
cussed in 7.5 however provides a good structural pattern for Καστιάνειρα. The FC
shows the zero grade *k ̑n̥d- of the root *k ̑end- ‘to excel, to be visible’, provided
with the compositional marker -ti-. The different treatment of the Kompositions-
fuge in Καστιάνειρα and Κασσάνδρα (the latter showing regular palatalization)
may be due to rhythmical factors, as suggested by García Ramón (1992: 255) but
consideration should also be given to the context in which Καστιάνειρα occurs.
This a hapax identifying one of Priam’s wives (the mother of Teucros) in Il. 8.305:
since palatalization is a phonologically secondary stage, ensuing from the orig-
inal /Kasti-/, this FC may have been blocked in its original shape by the metre.
124 The information in LSJ s.v. βόσκω that the sigmatic aorist is not attested before the tenth-cen-
tury AD collection of agricultural information that goes under the title of Geoponica must be cor-
rected. Forms of the sigmatic aorist occur earlier in καταβόσκω (cf. for instance κατεβοσκήσατο
in Long. Daph. et Chloe 2.16.1.5).
125 Nielsen Whitehead (2012: 75–77) on the other hand suggests that βωτι- might have been
blocked by the analogy with other Homeric compounds ending in -ανειρα and whose FCs have a
trochaic pattern, such as Καστιάνειρα, ἀντιάνειρα and κῡδιάνειρα.
126 Nielsen Whitehead (2012: 79) similarly explains the FC as being analogical on the agent noun
Κάστωρ.

8.6 ἀρτιεπής
The last compound which may be interpreted as a V1 form in -ti- is ἀρτιεπής ‘ready
of speech’. As remarked in 7.1, the Homeric adjectives in ἀρτι- are usually linked to
the adverb ἄρτι ‘exactly’ or to the adjective ἄρτιος ‘ready’.127 However, it is equally
probable that the FC originally contained the root *h2er-, as we have proposed for
the Mycenaean PN a-ti-pa-mo /Artiphāmos/: this name and the Homeric epithet
ἀρτιεπής would both mean ‘he who fits together words’.
     This original meaning of the FC however is no longer reflected in the other
two Homeric adjectives in ἀρτι-, ἀρτίπους ‘sound of foot’ and ἀρτίφρων ‘sound
of mind’: here, the FC has the function of a determiner and the compounds have
possessive semantics. With this sub-type in ἀρτι- we thus witness the morpho-
logical re-interpretation and semantic evolution of the old -ti- type at work: while
ἀρτιεπής is still explainable as an old V1 compound, based on the bare root, the
other two are formed according to new syntactic and semantic patterns, in which
ἀρτι- is no longer a governing element but acquires the meaning of the adjective
ἄρτιος.
8.7 Summary
From the above analyses we can draw the conclusion that the few Homeric forms
in -τι- were not preserved because they were associated with non-assibilating
dialects. In Homeric Greek, -τι- forms are relics which were blocked either by
the impossibility of re-analyzing them into more common patterns (for instance
because of the absence of an s-aorist, as argued for βωτιάνειρα and Καστιάνειρα)
or by conservatism, as in the case of ̓ρτίλοχος vs. its more recent form ̓ρσίλοχος,
and Δωτώ (blocked because it is a short form). βητ́ρμων might also have been
preserved because of a transparent semantic connection with the stem of the root
aorist ἔβην, since it could—but does not—change into βησ-. ἀρτιεπής on the other
hand shows that morphological reanalysis of the FC could trigger the creation of
other compounds in -τι- which were no longer based on verbal stems.
     These compounds in -τι- are a very ancient relic already in Homeric Greek,
where the productive derivational patterns of V1 compounds are only the
φερέοικος type, mostly based on present stems, and the τερψίμβροτος type,
mostly based on the s-aorist. The next chapter will explore how this bipartite
system of V1 compounds was exploited to meet the needs of the language, achiev-
ing a good degree of productivity.

208          Chapter Four – The Historical Perspective
9 Conclusion
This chapter has dealt with a vast range of issues, which have been discussed
adopting a historical approach. On the methodological level, we have seen that
the analysis of a linguistic phenomenon which characterizes a language (here,
V1 compounds in Greek) can greatly benefit from the adoption of a comparative
perspective. Although this chapter has dealt with other ancient and modern IE
languages only briefly, this comparative approach has helped us to reach the fol-
lowing conclusions:
– There are two types of V1 compounds which seem have been shared by more
    than one ancient IE language: compounds in -e- (Greek, Sanskrit, Iranian)
    and compounds in -ti- (Vedic, Greek).
– Although the extant Vedic -ti- compounds are better analysed as bahuvrihis,
    it is very likely that these few specimina continue an inherited V1 type, which
    Vedic lost as such and remade into a bahuvrihi pattern.
– The Greek -si- type does not have cognates in other ancient languages: the
    very few Latin compounds in -si- (e.g. versipellis) are ambiguous and are
    better interpreted according to different patterns (e.g. by assuming that the
    FC is a participle).
– Greek compounds in -si- may be seen to have arisen out of those in -ti- uniquely
    as a result of assibilation. However, their early association with the s-aorist
    encourages—if only on a speculative level—the hypothesis that a direct der-
    ivation from the s-aorist may have been operative independently of assibila-
    tion and perhaps even at earlier chronological stages than Greek itself. In this
    hypothetical scenario, the lack of -si- forms in Indo-Iranian would not be too
    surprising, given that in this branch V1 compounds of all types are limited
    and tend to be re-analysed to fit more popular patterns.
– The -ti- element seems to have mostly characterized V1 compounds based
    on bare, mostly full-grade, roots: the residual and often obscure character of
    -ti- compounds can be better understood starting from the assumption that
    in Greek they survived mostly when their transformation into -si- compounds
    was not supported by sigmatic tenses. This is often connected to the fact that
    the root aorist was the primary formation from these roots and in many cases
    was still attested in early Greek. This type in -ti- was prototypically opposed
    to a type employing present stems and characterized by the element -e-.
    However, the use of different stems or roots should not be taken to imply that
    the FCs express an aspectual opposition.
The development and productivity of V1 compounds in Greek must be sought
beyond the possible origin of their FCs in PIE and depends on the morphological

and analogical mechanisms at play in the language. The next two chapters will
focus on the formal and semantic interaction of V1 compounds with agent nouns
and V2 compounds: a full understanding of the properties of V1 compounds as
a whole cannot be reached without good knowledge of the formal make-up of
corresponding verbal derivations, particularly in the case of verbs whose deriva-
tional rate is high.

Chapter Five –
The Analysis of V1 Compounds Within the Greek
Compound System
Part I: V1 Compounds Without V2 Counterparts
1 Introduction         Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
Having investigated the origin of V1 compounds in PIE and their early history in
Greek, we now come to the analysis of their diachronic development in the lan-
guage. As noted in Chapters 2 and 3, V1 compounds are not a marginal type, but
a relatively productive compound category which interacts with other categories
of verbal compounds. The very few studies which have addressed the coexistence
of V1 and V2 compounds have tended to attribute it to the freedom characterizing
the onomastic domain (Bechtel and Fick 1894), to the alleged ‘creativity’ of the
Greek language (Andriotis 1938), or to a supposed semantic distinction between
the two patterns (Benveniste 1967).1 However, none of these short contributions
to the question has attempted a full study of all the categories of V1 compounds in
their formal, semantic and stylistic relation to V2 compounds: as a consequence,
the explanations proposed for the coexistence of these patterns are usually the
result of an impressionistic approach to the topic.
     This and the next chapter aim to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive
study of the productivity, morphological peculiarities and semantics of Greek V1
compounds, and to do so not by treating them as an isolated category, but by
examining their interaction with other verbal categories which express similar
semantics: V2 compounds in -ος (Chapter 2, section 6.3), in -της (Chapter 2,
section 6.4), in -ής (Chapter 2, section 6.2), and a few less common categories
(Chapter 2, sections 6.5 and 6.8). Both chapters begin with a morphological anal-
ysis of the base verbs which generate V1 compounds. This is necessary for an
understanding of the formal constraints which may have influenced the high or
low productivity of a given compound structure. An issue that has been entirely
overlooked in the literature concerns the large number of V1 compounds which
do not have a V2 counterpart (entries marked as Classes I and II in the Corpus).
This was certainly a factor in the development of individual types (‘families’) of
V1 compounds, and the productivity and morphological features of these various
types are addressed in full in this chapter.
     At a further level of analysis, this morphological approach must be comple-
mented by a semantic study of individual V1 and V2 families which takes into

consideration the type of text in which they are attested. This analysis is of course
central to the V1–V2 comparison addressed in Chapter 6, but it is also beneficial for
a better understanding of that particular class of verbs which generate agent nouns
but not V2 compounds (Class II) and for which, therefore, the V1 pattern is the only
productive one. In the case of this group of verbs, morphological analysis alone is
not sufficient to explain patterns of development and needs to be complemented
by a study of the base verbs, their uncompounded agent nouns, and V1 compounds
in context. The reasons for the lack of V2 compounds derived from a given verb may
differ, ranging from semantic restrictions (e.g. the base verb is used in a limited
range of meanings, or the agent nouns derived from the base verb have become
specialized as technical terms) to limitations of register or chronology (e.g. the base
verb itself is rare, or associated with specific registers, or ceases to be used early
on in the history of the language). These factors must be weighed carefully before
turning to the function fulfilled by individual V1 compounds.
     The semantic and morphological analysis adopted in this chapter for the
study of Class I (V1 compounds without a V2 counterpart: section 4) and Class
II (V1 compounds derived from verbs which have simple agent nouns but not
V2 compounds: section 5) sets the stage for the study of the interaction between
V1 and V2 compounds (Class IV). Chapter 6 goes to the core of the question by
investigating why the V1 type, a recessive category in Indo-European, becomes a
popular pattern in Greek, a language in which V2 compounds are extremely pro-
ductive. By applying this morphological and semantic approach, both chapters
contribute insights which counter the notion that V1 compounds only survived as
stylistic devices of the onomastic and poetic lexicons, arguing instead that they
filled semantic and morphological gaps associated with both the base verbs and
the agent nouns and V2 compounds to which these verbs give rise.
2 Setting up the V1–V2 comparison: corpus and methodology
The V1 compounds collected in the Corpus derive from one hundred and fif-
ty-eight different verbs. Eighty V1 families, almost half of the corpus, have a V2
counterpart (types φερέικος / οἰκοφόρος, ἐλάσιππος / ἱππηλάτης, μαίνανδρος /
γυναιμανής, ἀναξίαλος / ἀστυάναξ), while seventy-eight have none. This diver-
gence encourages a twofold approach to the study of the relationship between V1
and V2 compounds. On the one hand, the analysis must focus on competing V1–
V2 pairs and consider the potential morphological, semantic, and stylistic factors
determining the differentiation and coexistence of the two patterns. One question
of particular pertinence is why, with a V2 compound derived from the same verb
already in existence, V1 compounds were nevertheless created. These and similar

questions will be addressed in Chapter 6. On the other hand, the large number
of V1 compounds without a V2 counterpart need to be studied in their own right.
The first question is whether there are any morphological factors which impede
the creation of V2 compounds and agent nouns from a given verb (Class I): an
example of this situation is the verb δείδω ‘fear’, which generates V1 compounds
such as Δεισήνωρ ‘fearing men’ and δεισιδαίμων ‘fearing the gods’, but possesses
neither agent nouns nor V2 compounds. As we shall see, the forty-two verbs in
this class share a number of morphological properties, while the V1 compounds
they generate are often one-off specimina or rare forms: morphology, combined
with semantics and stylistics, brings to light the factors likely to be responsible
for the lack of V2 compounds and agent nouns.
     Another important question we face when considering V1 compounds without
a V2 counterpart is why such a large number of verbs (thirty-three) produce agent
nouns and yet fail to make use of them in compounding (Class II). An example is
μέλλω ‘hesitate’. In spite of the existence of the agent noun μελλητής ‘hesitating
person, one who waits’ already in Thucydides, this verb does not create V2 com-
pounds and the V1 pattern (μελλόγαμος ‘awaiting marriage’, Soph.) is the only
option. Even taking into account the fact that AG is a ‘dead’ language, this lack
of V2 compounds cannot simply be ascribed to chance: the analysis provided in
sections 5.1–5.3.2 focuses on issues surrounding the semantics and productivity of
both the base verbs and their agent nouns in order to highlight recurrent patterns
that might serve to explain the lack of V2 compounds derived from certain verbs.
     A different issue again concerns the in-betweenness of verbs and com-
pounds belonging to Class III. These three verbs (e.g. λείπω ‘leave’) fully exploit
the morphological means of creating agent nouns and V2 compounds, but they
do not admit compounding with nominals and only allow preverbs (e.g. ἐπιλοι-
πός ‘remaining’): as a consequence, the status of Class III is ambiguous in that
there are no morphological constraints on the creation of V2 compounds, but the
special semantic restrictions in force prevent the use of these agentive SCs with
nominal FCs. In the study of Classes I, II and III we will often have cause to con-
sider the formal make-up of simple and compounded agent nouns, and it is for
this reason that an analysis of agent nouns must form an integral part of the study
of V1 compounds in the context of the Greek compound system.

compounds and agent nouns it generates (or does not generate), it is vital to take
a close look at the morphology of the verbal roots themselves and at the type of
verbal paradigm which, from a synchronic perspective, a given root produces in
Greek. The reason this is such an important issue is that paradigmatic regularity
and transparency often guide the choices that speakers make regarding the cre-
ation and regular use of deverbative formations. By contrast, irregularity—be it
morphological, such as suppletivism, or phonological—obscures the formal and
semantic links between forms and may be responsible for the unproductive char-
acter of many verbal stems. This might explain, for instance, the low productivity
of V1 and V2 compounds derived from ἀραρίσκω (Class IV: Chapter 6, section 3.2;
see also Chapter 4, section 7.1).
4 Class I: V1 compounds derived from verbs which give rise
4 neither to a V2 compound nor to an agent noun
The following forty-two verbs all form the basis of V1 compounds, but at the same
time create neither active V2 compounds nor, it appears, simple agent nouns:
ἀάω ‘hurt’, ἄγαμαι ‘admire’, ἀγαπάω ‘love’, ἁμαρτάνω ‘fail’, ἀμέρδω ‘deprive’,
ἀμεύομαι ‘surpass’, ἁνδάνω ‘please’, βούλομαι ‘wish’, βρίθω ‘weigh down’,
βρύω ‘swell with’, γάνυμαι ‘brighten up’, δείδω ‘fear’, δοκέω ‘seem, pretend’,
εἷλον ‘take’, εἴλω ‘press’, ἐλελίζω ‘whirl round, cause to vibrate’, ἐρείπω ‘throw
down’, ἴσχω ‘hold’, κάπτω ‘gulp down’, κείρω ‘crop’, κέκασμαι ‘surpass’, κιχάνω
‘reach’, κύρω ‘obtain’, λαγχάνω ‘obtain by lot’, λανθάνω ‘escape notice, make
one forget’, λήγω ‘stop’, μείγνυμι ‘mix’, μέμφομαι ‘blame’, μίμνω ‘stand’, μίσγω
‘mix’, πίμπλημι ‘fill’, ῥίπτω ‘throw’, σπένδω ‘pour’, σπεύδω ‘urge’, στυγέω ‘hate’,
σχήσω ‘hold’ (future of ἔχω), τανύω ‘stretch’, τίλλω ‘pluck’, τυγχάνω ‘hit upon,
meet’, φθίνω ‘consume’, χρέμπτομαι ‘spit’. The root giving rise to the FC ἐν(ν)οσι-
‘shake’, as yet unidentified, can be added to this group.
On the whole, with a few exceptions analysed below, most of these verbs share
a certain characteristic: they are neither based on ablauting CeC-/CoC- roots
(τρέφω), which give rise to agent nouns in CoC-os (τροφός), the most popular
type of agent nouns used in compounding (κουροτρόφος); nor are they based
on Greek presents in short vowel (ἄρχω), which give rise to -ος agent nouns with
short vocalic grade (ἀρχός), another popular type in compounding (στράταρχος).
Their only means of creating an agent noun is to use the base root and add the
suffixes -τηρ, -τωρ or -της: the lack of such forms for these verbs may of course be
due merely to chance, but we will see below that other factors are perhaps at play.

      The verbs which give rise to the V1 compounds in this group belong to the
following categories:
– Full-grade thematic radical presents: ἀμέρδω, ἐρείπω (displaying ablaut in the
      thematic aorist ἤριπον), λήγω, σπεύδω. The following verbs derive from ablau-
      ting CeC/CoC roots, but ablaut is not part of their paradigm and only features in
      deverbal nouns: μέμφομαι (μομφή ‘blame’), σπένδω (σπονδή ‘libation’).
– Reduplicated presents: δείδω, ἐλελίζω, ἴσχω, μίμνω, πίμπλημι.
– Roots which form the present with nasal infixes and suffixes: ἁμαρτάνω,
      ἁνδάνω, βούλομαι, γάνυμαι, εἴλω/εἰλέω, κιχάνω, λαγχάνω, λανθάνω, μείγνυμι/
      μίγνυμι, τανύω, τυγχάνω, φθίνω.2
– -σκω presents: μίσγω (< *mik ̑/g̑-sk ̑é-).
– -jé/ó- presents from consonantal roots: κάπτω, κείρω, χρέμπτομαι.3
– -jé/ó- or -éje/o- presents which yield vocalic verbs in Greek: δοκέω, στυγέω.
– Reduplicated perfects: κέκασμαι.
– Thematic aorists: εἷλον (suppletive aorist of αἱρέω, from the root *selh1-).4
– Futures: σχήσω (alternative future of ἔχω ‘have’, from the zero grade *sg̑h- of
      the root).
– Nine verbs of unclear etymology or formation: ἀάω5, ἄγαμαι6, ἀγαπάω,
      ἀμεύομαι7, βρίθω8, βρύω9, κύρω10, ῥίπτω,11 τίλλω. The FC ἐνοσι- too is of
      obscure origin: it is certainly connected with the -σις noun ἔνοσις, but it is
      unclear whether it derives from a verbal root.12
2 Some of these verbs are very old in origin, to the point that the original n-infix or suffix is no
longer visible, as in βούλομαι (if this reconstruction is correct: see LIV 208, EDG s.v.: another pop-
ular interpretation is that the Greek present was formed with the desiderative suffix -s- ), or the
verb has been remodelled, as in the case of εἴλω/εἰλέω < *wel-n. Other verbs were created within
Greek by adding the suffix -αν-, e.g. ἁμαρτάνω, formed on the basis of the inherited zero-grade
aorist ἥμαρτον: LIV 281.
3 χρέμπτομαι is seemingly a *-jé/ó- present formed on the same root from which χρεμετίζω de-
rives, unless -πτ- is based on the analogy of the other verb for ‘spit’ πτύω: see GEW ii, 1116.
4 Harđarson (1993: 156, 166).
5 The connection with ἄτη is beyond doubt, but the verb cannot be a denominative derivation
from it: see GEW i, 2, 178; EDG 3.
6 EDG 7 derives it from the intensive prefix ἀγα-, a derivation which GEW i, 5 considers less
likely.
7 GEW i, 92; EDG 87 tentatively suggests *h2meu-.
8 From βρῖ ‘heavily’ through a θ-enlargement? See EDG, s.v. βρῖ.
9 GEW i, 274–275; EDG 246.
10 GEW ii, 46; EDG 808–809.
11 From *u̯r-ī-p-? See GEW ii, 659. EDG 1288 however deems this etymology ‘highly implausible’,
suggesting a proto-Greek origin for the verb.

216         Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
Here we have a coherent group of verbs whose lack of V2 compounds can be
attributed, first and foremost, to the impossibility of deriving an -ος agent noun
from them: the verbs which allow this type of formation are only three of those
listed in the first typology. In the second place, semantic factors may have inter-
vened to block the creation of agent nouns in -της, -τηρ or -τωρ, since there are no
particular phonological constraints on the formation of agents nouns of this kind
from the roots in this group of verbs. The lack of agent nouns is therefore likely to
depend on the combined constraints of morphology (i.e. the difficulty of creating
an easily compoundable and transparent agent noun) and semantics. I provide a
few interpretative suggestions below.
     Some verbs may have been too rare or elevated in register to build productive
agent nouns. An example is the epic verb ἀάω ‘damage’, seldom used in other
poetic genres. Moreover, ἀάω is semantically restricted: it refers solely to damage
done to the mind, whether through infatuation, deception or intoxication. Its
agent noun would consequently have the specialized meaning ‘one who damages
the mind’ and would not convey the general idea of ‘damaging’: this is further
confirmed by the semantic specialization of the deverbal personified form Ἄτη
‘she who blinds one’s mind’. Similarly, ἐλελίζω ‘whirl round, cause to vibrate’ is
a poetic verb associated with epic, where it is used mostly for actions involving
weapons or the shaking of earth and mountains on the part of the gods. Its poetic
status is confirmed by the fact that it is glossed in Apollonius Sophista’s Homeric
lexicon (66.5 Bekker).
     Two other rare verbs are ἀμεύομαι ‘surpass’ and the old perfect κέκασμαι ‘I
am adorned’. ἀμεύομαι is a Doric form corresponding to ἀμείβομαι. It is mostly
confined to Cretan inscriptions and highly poetic language (Pindar, Euphorion).
The V1 compounds are similarly poetic (Pindar), while the few onomastic forms
are mostly attested in West-Greek regions. κέκασμαι and its new present καίνυμαι
are mostly associated with epic poetry, particularly in their original meaning of
‘surpass’ (in later texts we sometimes find the meaning ‘to adorn’): already in Hel-
lenistic Greek forms of καίνυμαι are attested exclusively in poetry or lexicography,
and soon the only form of the verb remains the perfect participle κεκασμένος/
κεκαμμένος. The rarity of this verb is matched by the recessive character of the
PNs based on it: in particular, the old-fashioned shape of the FC of Kαστιάνειρα
may have contributed to ousting this name from the onomastic practice of later
Greek, while the opacity of its connection with κέκασμαι, itself a scarcely produc-
tive verb in word formation, may have prevented the creation of new forms.
     In other cases, a given agent noun may have been redundant on account of
the availability of synonyms. For instance, ἀγαπάω ‘love’ and στέργω ‘love, be
fond of’ may have suffered competition from the common agent nouns derived
from the synonymous verbs φιλέω and ἔραμαι; while τάνυμαι and τανύω ‘stretch’,

                                      4 Class I: V1 compounds derived from verbs        217
which are mostly poetic (with the exception of astronomical prose, where they
are common), encompass the same semantics as the more pervasive τείνω, which
gives rise to V2 compounds in -τονος. As another example, we may consider the
case of κάπτω ‘gulp down’, which signifies a specific mode of eating associated
with animals. The verb was particularly popular in comedy, where it was associ-
ated with lower-class people.13 However, in comic language gluttons are instead
designated with the term κατωφαγᾶς/καταφαγᾶς ‘eating with the head down’,
a derivative of φαγεῖν, which conveys a similarly bestial resonance (animals
eat with their head down). The popularity of V2 compounds from φαγεῖν may
therefore have contributed to making agent nouns and compounds derived from
κάπτω seem superfluous.
     Some of the verbs in Class I develop verbal compounds in -ής, but these are
always passive and usually quite rare: see the entries on βρίθω, εἴλω, λανθάνω,
μείγνυμι, μέμφομαι and ῥίπτω in the Corpus, and, further, Chapter 6, section 4.3.
In the case of these verbs, we must rule out the possibility that morphological
constraints played a role in blocking the development of an active compound in
-ής: rather, this is to be attributed to semantic factors, as well as to the fact that the
acquisition of an active meaning is a much more sporadic and patchy phenomenon
in the development of verbal compounds in -ής (Chapter 6, section 4.1).
     Rarity, stylistic specialization and the competition of synonyms are not rel-
evant to the case of all the verbs in Class I, but the adoption of a more nuanced
approach, combining morphology, phonology and semantics, may help us to sift
through the material and spot trends in this group. The relative rarity of some
verbs, which often occur in fixed poetic images to the point of appearing almost
semantically specialized, and the fact that others were in competition with more
popular verbs are not just possible factors in the lack of agent nouns: they often
influenced the make-up, meaning and productivity of the V1 compounds them-
selves.
     If we look at the quantity and chronological distribution of the V1 compounds
in Class I, we note that only the seventeen families analysed in section 4.3 below
comprise more than four items, while most of the remaining families are not only
smaller in number, but are often represented by only a single item (notably those
derived from ἀάω, ἀγαπάω, βρίθω, βρύω, γάνυμαι, ἐλελίζω, κάπτω, κέκασμαι,
κιχάνω, κύρω, λαγχάνω, μέμφομαι, σπένδω, σχήσω, τυγχάνω and χρέμπτομαι:
sixteen out of forty-two verbs). Moreover, most of the V1 compounds in Class I
are used in poetry and onomastics, and the productivity of individual FCs usually
wanes in post-Classical Greek.

218          Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
4.1 Poetic verbs and rare V1 compounds
There is a correlation between poetic verbs (i.e. verbs attested mostly in poetry,
which often also have only a few attestations) and the low, if not non-existent
productivity of certain compound forms.
ἀάω
The compound derived from ἀάω, ἀεσίφρων, and its derivation ἀεσιφροσύνη
‘folly’ are both Homeric creations, corresponding to syntagms joining ‘mind’ and
‘damaging’ (e.g., φρένας ἄασε οἴνῳ ‘he damaged his heart with wine’, Od. 21.297).
After Homer and Hesiod, ἀεσίφρων is used only by Quintus Smyrnaeus: its poetic
status is confirmed by its appearance as a lemma in the popular Homeric lexicon
of Apollonius Sophista. As is the case with other poetic V1 formations, this com-
pound is quite artificial: the FC does not correspond to any stem of ἀάω (the sig-
matic tenses have the shape ἀασ-: see, however, the later forms ἀασίφρων, Hsch.,
and ἀασιφρονία, Phot.). Moreover, the semantics of the whole compound is not
agentive: the SC does not fulfil the function of the object (‘damaging the mind’)
but rather restricts the meaning of the FC as an adjunct (‘damaged in the mind’).
ἀγαπάω
This is a rare verb in early Greek and features in only one compound, ἀγαπήνωρ,
used in Homer both as a PN and as an adjective meaning ‘loving manliness’. This
meaning depends on a restricted understanding of the SC -ήνωρ as ‘fighting men,
warriors’, rather than simply ‘men’ or ‘human kind’. The adjective is not used
much after early epic, but is often commented upon in lexica such as those of
Apollonius Sophista and Hesychius.
ἀμέρδω
This is a poetic verb. The three compounds in ἀμερσι-, based on the stem of the
aorist and future, are late (Nonnus, Hesychius) and perhaps parallel the late cre-
ation of the action noun ἄμερσις ‘deprivation’, first attested in Eustathius.
ἀμεύομαι
This is believed by some to be a Doric form:14 it is attested in Pindar, where we
also find the only two appellative compounds derived from it, ἀμευσιεπής ‘sur-
passing words’ (reflecting the meaning of the verb ‘surpass’) and ἀμευσίπορος
‘shifting paths’ (reflecting the semantic similarity of the verb to ἀμείβομαι ‘change
one with another’). These are based on the only attested tenses of this verb, the
14 See LSJ and DGE s.vv.; EDG (ἀμεύσασθαι) is more cautious.

sigmatic future and aorist. It would appear that this is a process of word forma-
tion internal to Pindar’s poetic language: outside Pindar, ἀμευσιεπής is only used
once in Hesychius. The meaning ‘purchase’ for ἀμεύομαι is perhaps attested in
Cretan (GDI 4964). This would give a more fitting meaning to the PN  ̓Αμεύσιππος
‘one who purchases horses’. It is also possible that here the SC represents the
thing or field in which one individual surpasses the rest: thus, the Cretan name
 ̓Αμευσίχαρμος may perhaps be understood as ‘surpassing in joy or ‘procuring
joy’.
βρίθω
This poetic verb is very common in early epic. It produces only one V1 compound,
βρισάρματος ‘weighing down chariots’, which is created within the later epic
corpus (the pseudo-Hesiodic Shield and the probably late-antique Homeric Hymn
to Ares). While this compound employs the stem of sigmatic tenses, the present
stem may perhaps have been used in the Mycenaean PN qi-ri-ta-ko (see Chapter
4, section 5, with table 4.2).
εἰλέω
This verb and and its by-forms εἴλω, εἴλλω, ἴλλω etc. are common in epic lan-
guage. Mirroring the specialization of the base verbs, the only V1 compound—the
adjective εἰλίπους ‘rolling the feet, moving the feet with a rotary movement’—
remains a popular epic epithet of oxen down to Late Antiquity, with the variant
εἰλιπόδης in Nonnus.
ἐλελίζω
As noted above, this verb is used mostly in early poetry, particularly with the
meaning ‘cause to vibrate’. This meaning is also conveyed by the only compound
derived from the verb, the Pindaric epithet ἐλελίχθων ‘shaking the earth’, which
after Pindar is used only by Aeschylus.
ἐρείπω
This typically epic verb is often used in conjunction with cities, their walls and
doors. These associations persist in the two V1 compounds, ἐρειψιπύλᾱς ‘over-
throwing gates’ and ἐρειψίτοιχος ‘overthrowing walls’, which first appear in
fifth-century poetry (Bacch., Aesch.) and are not used after that date.
μίσγω
This is a poetic (mostly epic) cognate of the more common μείγνυμι ‘mix, mingle
with’. Of the three compounds derived from its present stem, μισγάγκεια ‘place
where waters meet’ is Homeric and confirms the epic flavour of the verb, while
                                                     Olga Tribulato - 9783110415827

220          Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
the PN Μισγόλᾱς, attested in an Attic inscription, looks like a non-Attic name
(the SC would be -λεως in Attic). In both cases we can reconstruct a V1 struc-
ture meaning ‘making the waters meet’, which yields the current meaning ‘place
where waters meet’ (for a similar meaning see also μισγοδία ‘place where streets
meet’, Ηsch.), and ‘he who mingles with the people’, which yields ‘he who comes
from a mixed people’. The evolution in the semantics of V1 compounds in μισγo-,
which draws closer to that of determinative compounds, mirrors the development
of the popular class of compounds in μιξο-, on which see section 4.4.
στυγέω
This is a less common synonym of ἐχθαίρω ‘hate’ and is mostly a poetic verb. The
only two compounds, στυγάνωρ ‘hating the male sex’ (Aesch.) and the almost
synonymous στυγόδεμνος ‘hating marriage’ (Agathias), are both poetic. In the
latter, the FC in -o- may perhaps be influenced by the FC μισο- from the synony-
mic verb μισέω ‘hate’.
χρέμπτομαι
Probably an onomatopeic formation, this verb is attested twice in Attic comedy
(Aristoph., Eup.), where we also find the compound χρεμψιθέατρος ‘he who spits
in the theatre’, transmitted as an anonymous adespoton by Hesychius, the Suda
and the Λέξεις κωμικαί. The FC is based on the s-aorist, attested in the Corpus
Hippocraticum for the first time.
In all these eleven examples there seems to be a clear correlation between the rarity
and/or poetic status of the base verb and the character of the compounds derived
from it: they are always attested in poetry, usually describe unusual actions (e.g.
ἀμερσίγαμος ‘robbing of wedlock’, ἐλελίχθων ‘earth-shaking’, ἐρειψιπύλᾱς ‘over-
throwing gates’, χρεμψιθέατρος ‘spitting in the theatre’), and are often one-off
formations. Lexica and commentaries aside, ἀεσίφρων, ἀγαπήνωρ, ἀμευσιεπής,
ἀμευσίπορος, βρισάρματος, ἐλελίχθων, ἐρειψιπύλᾱς, ἐρειψίτοιχος, μισγάγκεια,
στυγάνωρ, στυγόδεμνος and χρεμψιθέατρος are not productive after their first
attestations in early poetry. On the other hand, ἀμερσίγαμος and ἀμερσίνοος only
make their first appearance in Late Antiquity. Of the compounds discussed, the
only forms which have a few attestations after the Classical age are ἀγαπήνωρ and
εἰλίπους (the latter confined to epic poetry).
     Compounds with the FC ἐν(ν)οσί-, which are not linked to an attested verb,
only survive either as cultic epithets of Poseidon (all attested for the first time
within the fifth century BC) or—in the case of εἰνοσίφυλλος—as an epithet of
mountains. The existence of the action noun ἔνοσις ‘shaking’ (Hes.) ensured that

the meaning of the FC was not obscure to speakers, and the popularity of these
forms led the learned John of Gaza (sixth c. AD) to coin another ἐνοσί-compound
in his Ecphrasis, ἐνοσίφρων ‘shaking the mind’. The etymology of the FC of these
compounds is unidentified but, given the presence of e-ne-si-da-o-ne in Myce-
naean and its seemingly different vocalism, it has been suggested that the root
behind it was of Minoan origin.15

Another large portion of these verbs of low productivity give rise only to ono-
mastic compounds. These include: ἄγαμαι, yielding several names;16 ἁνδάνω,
yielding the Kurzname ϝhαδήσιος as well as, probably, ϝασάνωρ and other
names in ϝασ-; βρύω (the FC may be attested in the Kurzname Βρύσων); γάνυμαι
(Γανυμήδης); κέκασμαι (Kαστιάνειρα); κιχάνω (Κιχήσιππος ‘one who overtakes
horses’?); λαγχάνω (Λαχέμοιρος ‘one ho obtains his portion (of land?)’); κύρω
(the FC may persist in the Kurzname Κυρσίλος); μίμνω (e.g. Μίμνερμος, a less pro-
ductive family than compounds derived from cognate μένω ‘stand’: see section
6); σπένδω (Σπενσίθεος ‘one who makes libations to the gods’?);17 σπεύδω (with
names probably reflecting the intransitive meaning ‘strive eagerly after some-
thing’: e.g. Σπεύσιππος ‘striving after horses’, Σπευσικλῆς ‘one who strives after
fame’?); σχήσω (Σχησίπολις ‘one who holds the city’); τυγχάνω (Τυχήσιππος).18
     With the exception of the names in  ̓Αγασι-, Mιμν(ο)- and Σπευσι-, most of these
formations seem to be isolated. Outside Γανυμήδης, Κιχήσιππος, Λαχέμοιρος,
Σπενσίθεος, Σχησίπολις and Τυχήσιππος, the FCs Γανυ-, Κιχησι-, Λαχε-, Σπενσι-,
Σχησι- and Τυχησι- are not used in other compounds; moreover, in three cases
the existence of a V1 compound is only reconstructed from a Kurzname (Βρύσων,
Κυρσίλος).
15 See Plath (1999), García Ramón (2009).
16 A few compounds in ΑΓΑΣΙ- from West-Greek areas are of ambiguous derivation and may
be thought to have their origin in ἡγεόμαι instead, since after the introduction of the Milesian
alphabet <H> was not used to denote initial aspiration. However, the fact that names such as
 ̓Αγασίλεως,  ̓Αγάσιππος and  ̓Αγασικλῆς are also attested in Attic-Ionic areas (where compounds
in ἀγασι- for ἡγησι- are not expected) seems to confirm the existence of PNs from ἄγαμαι. Judging
from the database in the LGPN, most of these names died out in the Hellenistic age, while the
others did not survive beyond the third c. AD.
17 On the unusual phonology of the FC, see the Corpus s.v.
18 Τυχήσιππος may reflect the meaning ‘obtain something’ of its base verb, but it may also be
the case that the FC is influenced by τύχη and that the name is not formed according to the V1
pattern.

222         Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
4.3 Common verbs, rare V1 families (less than four items)
Other compound families derive from common Greek verbs but do not share their
popularity. The great majority of these compounds are attested in poetic texts: we
will consider their use in the light of the semantics of the base verbs.
βούλομαι
Though a pervasive verb in Greek, βούλομαι yields only one clear V1 compound,
βουλόμαχος ‘desiring strife’. This seems to have been coined by Aristophanes
to mock Lysimachus’ name (in Pax 1293 it is also followed by the rhyming
κλαυσίμαχος ‘rue-the-fight’: see section 5.3.2), a fact which strengthens the
impression that compounds in βουλο- were not productive in Greek. A likely
reason is that βούλομαι is typically construed with the infinitive, while construc-
tions with a direct object are rare and often limited to the meaning ‘wanting
something for someone, wishing someone something’ (e.g. Τρώεσσιν [...] ἐβούλετο
νίκην ‘he wished victory for the Trojans’, Il. 7.21). Note that compounds derived
from the synonymous ἐθέλω ‘want’ likewise do not express the notion ‘want
something’, but are used to identify individuals who do something volunta-
rily, such as ἐθελοπρόξενος ‘voluntary proxenos’, thereby evolving into a kind
of determinative compounds (see section 3.3.1). As in compounds in ἐθελο-, the
linking element -ο- is probably influenced by the thematic vowel used in the first
ps. sg. βούλομαι.
δοκέω
This is another extremely popular verb, but the V1 compounds derived from it
are almost all associated with comic language. δοκησιδέξιος ‘clever in one’s own
conceit’ features in Pherecrates fr. 163 K-A, while Pollux attributes the same com-
pound to Callias (fr. 34 K-A) and quotes it to gloss δοκησίνους ‘one who believes
himself to be clever’, a hapax.19 A third compound, δοκησίσοφος, appears in
Antipho and Aristophanes and is later frequently used by Philo Judaeus. In Aristo-
phanes Pax 44, δοκησίσοφος is used to describe ‘some young know-all’ person in
the audience who might be frowning in response to the play’s plot. The context in
19 The entry δοκησίνους in LSJ is misleading. It laconically says ‘foreg., ibid.’, referring to the
entry δοκησιδέξιος, where Pherecrates and Callias are quoted. From ‘ibid.’ one gets the im-
pression that δοκησίνους is also attested in Callias, but in fact Poll. 4.9, the source of Callias’
fragment, states that only δοκησιδέξιος was used by Callias: καὶ μέντοι καὶ δοκησίνους, ὃν καὶ
δοκησιδέξιον Καλλίας εἴρηκεν ὁ κωμικός (fr. 34 K-A). Olson (1998: 76), commenting on Aristoph.
Pax 44, perpetuates the mistake, whereas K-A in Callias fr. 34 correctly set δοκησιδέξιον apart in
the quotation: this is the only word to be attributed to Callias.

which δοκησιδέξιος is used in fr. 163 K-A from Pherecrates’ Pseuderacles may well
be comparable: the fragment begins with what seems to be the end of a similar
statement (εἴποι τις ἂν τῶν πάνυ δοκησιδεξίων ‘[thus] would speak one of those
exceedingly clever in their own conceit’) and may continue with a metapoetic
statement (ἐγὼ δ’ ἂν ἀντείποιμι· μὴ πολυπραγμόνει | ἀλλ’ εἰ δοκεῖ σοι, πρόσεχε
τὸν νοῦν κἀκροῶ ‘but I would answer: if you like, pay attention and listen’). The
appearance of two similar-looking compounds opens up the possibility that the
two passages were somehow related.20
εἷλον
The stem of this thematic aorist, completing the suppletive paradigm of αἱρέω, is
used in three compounds. They all feature in Aeschylus’ Agamemnon (vv. 689–690)
within a famous word-play on Helen’s name, etymologized as ‘the destroyer’. The
word-play begins with the allusive ἑλέναυς ‘destroying ships’, to which Aeschylus
adds ἕλανδρος ‘destroying men’ and ἑλέπτολις ‘destroying cities’. While ἑλέναυς
and ἕλανδρος remain rare words, ἑλέπτολις is also used by Euripides, and the
variant ἑλέπολις is the name of a war-engine and is often found in later sources.
κάπτω
This seems to have been a fairly common verb, but most of its attestations come
from comedy. It should not be surprising, then, that καψιδρώτιον ‘the thing which
gulps down saliva, napkin’ is attributed to an anonymous play of Middle Comedy
(adespoton 799 K-A) by Poll. 7.69, who glosses it with the Koine terms ἡμιτύβιον
and σουδάριον, both meaning ‘napkin’ (but Hesychius κ 1946 glosses this term
with εἶδος χιτωνίσκου ‘a kind of short tunic’). The structure suggests that this
was not a common name for the napkin, but rather a mockingly recherché term
coined as a one-off formation.
κείρω
This is the verb most frequently used for the action of cropping the hair and it
features in ἀκερσεκόμης (Hom.) and ἀκειρεκόμης (Soph.) ‘with unshaven hair,
not shaving the hair’, two rather artificial compounds often used as epithets of
Apollo.21 Their structure reflects the common phrases κόμην κερέειν (Il. 23.146)
and κείρασθαί τε κόμην (Od. 4.198) and, by negating this action, the compounds
evoke youth, beauty and happiness (to cut off one’s hair was a sign of mourning),
attributes particularly suited to Apollo. ἀκερσεκόμης originates within epic lan-
guage, since it employs the stem of the typically epic sigmatic aorist ἔκερσα (the
20 This hypothesis does not seem to have been discussed in the literature on Old Comedy.

224          Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
usual aorist of the verb is ἔκειρα). In ἀκειρεκόμης, seemingly built on the present
stem, this epic flavour is partly relinquished.
λήγω
This is another common verb in Greek. All compounds in ληξι-, which employ
the stem of the sigmatic tenses, are relatively late and typically function as tech-
nical terms. In Galen’s De antidotis 14.136.2 we find the pair ληξιπύρετα and
ληξιφάρμακα in a passage attributed to Asclepiades. Of the two forms, the former
is a proper V1 with causative meaning ‘stopping fever’, while the meaning ‘drugs
(φάρμακα) that have the property of stopping (fever)’ (cf. LSJ s.v.) identifies the
latter as a determinative compound in which the FC ληξι- has the function of a
modifier. Both Hippocrates and Galen very frequently describe the abatement of
high temperature by using forms of λήγω together with πυρετός or θέρμη ‘fever’:
the compound ληξιπύρετος seems to have been coined to express, in condensed
fashion, the property of the remedies which were meant to achieve this goal.22
The shape of the FC may also be influenced by the action noun λῆξις ‘cessation’,
but the existence of the variant ληξοπύρετος in several passages of Galen’s works
supports the hypothesis that verbal stems are the starting point for the process
of derivation of these V1 compounds. Another technical compound is ληξίφωτος
‘waning in light’, attested in the fourth-century AD astronomer Hephaestion
where it is opposed to αὐξίφωτος ‘waxing in light’: both probably reflect the pop-
ularity of the action noun λῆξις as an astronomical term.23
μέμφομαι
This is the standard verb for ‘to blame’ and remains so down to MG. In compar-
ison with this vitality, the existence of only one V1 compound and the lack of a
productive type of V2 compounds are surprising. However, μεμψίμοιρος ‘criticiz-
ing’ and its derivative μεμψιμοιρία ‘fault-finding’, both first used by Isocrates, are
still used in MG.
22 Cf. ὁ πυρετὸς ἐδόκει λῆξαι περὶ ἑβδόμην (Hippocr. Epid. 7.1.12) ‘fever seemed to stop on the
seventh day’; λήγοντος τοῦ πυρετοῦ (ibid. 4.1.25) ‘when fever ceased...’, while in Galen the most
frequent construct is with a form of λήγω followed by the prepositional clause εἰς ἀπυρεξίαν,
indicating conditions (often fevers) which finally end with the absence of high temperature.
23 Note that ληξίαρχος, the Athenian officer who kept order in the ἐκκλησία, does not belong
to the group of V1 in ληξι-: the head is -αρχος, which is modified by λῆξις, to be understood as
‘allotment, property’ (cf. the explanation in Poll. 8.104).

                                    4 Class I: V1 compounds derived from verbs       225
πίμπλημι
This is a common verb in both Classical and Koine Greek. Compounds in πλησι-
reflect the two basic meanings of the verb: the transitive meaning in πλησίστιος
‘filling the sails’ (Hom.), where the FC functions as the direct object of the verb;
and the stative-intransitive meaning ‘to be full’ conveyed by the middle and
passive aorist forms of the verb in πλησιφαής ‘being full of light, with full light’
(Man.) and in the PN Πλησικράτης ‘full of might’.
τίλλω
This verb is found in both poetry and prose, including the Septuagint, the New
Testament and some papyri: it seems, therefore, to have been an ordinary verb.
The sole V1 compound, τιλλοπώγων ‘one who plucks out his beard’, is only
attested in a one-word adespoton and it is consequently impossible to give greater
definition to the context of its usage. However, the compound is likely to reflect
the comic use of the verb in relation to effeminate men.24
The analysis of this subgroup comprising rare compounds derived from nine
common verbs gives us the opportunity to refine our understanding of the V1
compounds that make up Class I as a whole. Until now we have been noting
the probable correlation between poetic and/or rare verbs and mostly poetic
and rare compound families. The examples which we have just reviewed in this
section, however, serve to counter the idea that the productivity of compounds
is always a reflection of the productivity of their base verbs, since we here have
verbs as common as τίλλω, βούλομαι and μέμφομαι which fail to generate equally
common compounds. If one were to judge the productivity and distribution of the
V1 category as a whole on the basis of these families, a natural conclusion would
be that the compounds are highly literary and unusual. However, the productivity
of many other compounds, including those analysed in the next sections, again
suggests that a more cautious approach is advisable when it comes to evaluating
the V1 type.
4.4 Productive compound families of Class I (four items or more)
Even the verbs which, for statistical purposes, can be included among those
whose compounds are productive, do not produce large compound families: the
only exceptions are the compounds derived from μείγνυμι and τανύω. In most
cases, we are dealing with small, self-contained groups whose productivity may

226         Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
be connected to a specific linguistic register. Of these compounds, those derived
from ἄγαμαι and μίμνω are exclusively onomastic and have already been men-
tioned; the remaining ones are mostly poetic.
ἁμαρτάνω
This is a fairly common verb in Homer, where we also find the first appellative
compound derived from it, ἁμαρτοεπής ‘erring in words’. The selected stem cor-
responds to the thematic aorist, followed by -o- (as is often the case); or, less
frequently, by -ι-, which is probably based on the analogy of FCs in -τι-. As in the
Hesiodic ἁμαρτίνοος ‘erring in mind’, the SC performs the same syntactic func-
tion as the genitive or dative in phrases such as μύθων ἡμάρτανε ‘failed of good
speech’ (Il. 11.511) or ἐάν τις ῥήματι ἁμάρτͅ ‘if someone errs in his speech’ (Pl. Grg.
489c). ἁμαρτολόγος ‘speaking faultily’, first attested in Athenaeus, is construed
in the same way as ἁμαρτοεπής (though the accentuation on the SC is analogical
on V2 compounds from λέγω), while Nonnus’ hapax ἁμαρτίγαμος (D. 48.94) is
semantically ambiguous. The translation of this form in LSJ as ‘failing of mar-
riage’ reflects the other meaning of ἁμαρτάνω, ‘be deprived of’: accordingly, with
the expression ἁρμαρτιγάμων ὑμεναίων Nonnus would be implying that Pallene,
subjected to the illicit love of her father, has been deprived of a real marriage.
Vian (2003) however interprets the structure of ἁμαρτίγαμος as identical to that
of the other compounds deriving from ἁμαρτάνω and translates it as ‘d’une union
coupable’ (i.e. ‘erring in marriage’). ἁμαρτοεπής is rarely used after Homer, except
by Cyrillus, who is very fond of it; ἁμαρτίνοος, though uncommon, is attested in
poetry down to the age of Paulus Silentiarius. This family of compounds is thus
mostly linked to elevated registers, and this explains the limited productivity of
the individual items.
δείδω
This is another common verb: the few compounds in δεισι- are relatively produc-
tive, both in terms of longevity (δεισιδαίμων ‘fearing gods’ is routinely used from
Xenophon down to Late Antiquity and survives into MG) and in terms of creativ-
ity (with the new compounds ἀδεισιδαίμων and ἀδεισίθεος appearing as late as
Diodorus Siculus and Julian respectively).
ἴσχω
This reduplicated present, deriving from the same root as ἔχω, is used with
a stronger meaning than ἔχω, to express firm possession or even restraint of
something. This is particularly clear in the three appellative compounds used
as masonry technical terms (ἰσχέγαον, name of a type of wall ‘retaining earth’,
ἰσχέπλινθα ‘brick-retaining’, ἰσχέθυρον ‘door-retaining’), all attested in fourth/

third-century inscriptions. It is more difficult to assess whether V1 PNs derived
from ἴσχω are semantically differentiated from those in ἐχε-: for instance, Ἰσχένοος
could mean ‘he who restrains his mind’ rather than ‘he who has intelligence/
heart’, while the PNs  ̓Ισχέδᾱμος and Ἰσχόλᾱος could mean ‘he who restrains the
people’ or ‘he who firmly holds the people’.
λανθάνω, λήθω
Compounds in λαθι- and λησι-, all attested in poetic sources, derive from the
cognate verbs λανθάνω and λήθω: FCs in λᾰθι- employ the zero-grade root (contai-
ned in the thematic aorist ἔλαθον), while those in λησι- are based on the sigmatic
stem λησ-; FCs in λᾱθι-, as in λᾱθίπονος ‘forgetful of sorrow’, derive directly from
the present λήθω (where [ɛ:] is the Attic-Ionic result of [a:]) and are therefore West
Greek forms. All these compounds indicate, with causative meaning, someone
or something which renders forgetful (λᾰθικηδής ‘banishing care’, qualifying
μαζός ‘breast’ in Homer and οἶνος in Alcaeus) or, with transitive meaning, someone
who has forgotten something (λᾱθίπονος, or λαθίνοστος ‘forgetful of returning
home’). The image that λαθικηδής conveys in one word is also expressed, in more
extended fashion, by phrases in which the verbs are coupled with synonyms of
κῆδος ‘anxiety’: compare Il. 15.60 ὄφρα (Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων) [...] λελάθͅ (Ἕκτορα)
[...] ὀδυνάων ‘so that Apollo may cause Hector forget his pains’. λαθίπονος finds a
synonymous parallel in Eur. Alc. 198 ἄλγος, οὗ ποτ’ οὐ λελήσεται ‘pain, which
(Admetus) will never forget’, while λαθίνοστος ‘forgetful of returning home’,
attested in Hesychius but perhaps from a lost poetic text, compresses the Homeric
phrase νόστου τε λαθέσθαι (Od. 9.97). Another compound, λᾱθάνεμος ‘escaping
wind’ reflects another meaning of λανθάνω and λήθω, ‘to escape notice’, and cor-
responds to the phrase οὐδ’ ἀνέμους ἔλαθεν ‘he did not escape the winds’ (Pi.
Pa. VI, fr. 52f.110 Maehler). This meaning of the verb also features in λησίμβροτος
‘taking men unawares’ (H. Hom. Merc. 339), the only compound in which the FC
derives from the sigmatic tenses of the verb.
μείγνυμι
This common verb provides the stem for the very popular group of V1 compounds
in μιξο- and μειξι-, which indicate beings whose nature is mixed. In their dia-
chronic development these compounds trascended the typical V1 structure to
become, in practical terms, a type of determinative compound in which the FC
acquires the function of an adjective meaning ‘mixed’ and no longer governs the
SC (e.g. μιξολύδιος ‘half Lydian’). According to Risch, this meaning developed
out of obscured V1 compounds such as μισγάγκεια (section 4.1), which originally

228         Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
meant ‘making waters meet’, but later evolved into ‘meeting of the waters’.25
The original verbal meaning of the FC was perhaps also preserved in the PN
Μειξίδημος ‘he who mingles with the people’, and in μιξέλληνες, which Risch
interprets as having originally signified ‘people who mingle with the Greeks’.26
The evolution of μιξο- compounds into a kind of determinative compound, which
mirrors that of compounds in ἀρχι- (see Chapter 6, section 3.1), determines the
huge popularity of this type: the new understanding of the FC is also associated
with the use of the linking vowel -o, which signals the equation of the FC with a
nominal form.
ῥίπτω
This verb expresses the action of throwing something away with a sudden move-
ment. Although it is attested in Classical Greek, it becomes especially common
in the Koine. The compounds do not reflect this popularity, being instead tied to
specific images: ῥιψαύχην ‘tossing the neck’, often used as an epithet of horses
but employed for the first time by Pindar as an epithet of κλόνος ‘throng’, reflects
the use of ῥίπτω and its frequentative form ῥιπτάζω with bodily parts (see too
the later ῥιψόφθαλμος ‘casting the eyes about’, Ptol.). ῥίψοπλος ‘throwing away
one’s weapons’ (Aesch.) and ῥίψασπις ‘throwing away the shield’ (Aristoph.), on
the other hand, mirror the images in which ῥίπτω is coupled with weapons: e.g.
ἀσπίδα ῥίψας (Anacr. fr. 63b PMG) or ῥίψαντες τὰ ὅπλα (Plb. 4.69.7). The appel-
lative compounds are therefore all poetic in flavour, but it is interesting that the
only onomastic compound dates to the Archaic age.
τανύω
As noted above, τανύω is mostly used in poetry. The FCs of its productive com-
pounds derive from the present stem, which retains the -νυ- infix and does not
employ the vowel -ε-; a few are also enlarged in τανυσι-. The relatively high
number of V1 compounds from τανύω is perhaps best explained by taking two
factors into account. First, the more common synonym of τανύω, τείνω, does
not produce V1 compounds: compounds in τανυ- and τανυσι- may therefore fill a
semantic gap. Secondly, the group of Homeric compounds (which encompasses
the famous τανύπεπλος ‘stretching the robe’) seems to have provided a model imi-
tated by later authors (see particularly the compounds attested in the hexametric
poetry of Oppianus, Quintus Smyrnaeus and Nonnus collected in the Corpus). As
noted in the Corpus, the structure of these compounds is seldom governing: the
FC seems rather to function as an attribute of the SC (as e.g. in τανυήκης ‘with

a long point or edge’), so that the whole category may already at an early stage
have experienced a shift in structure and semantics. We can speculate whether
this semantic shift was encouraged by the fact that the FC ends in a vowel and
was thus equated to a nominal form (but there is no adjective **τανύς). This is the
most productive compound family in Class I as a whole.
φθίνω
This verb creates only three proper V1 compounds, all derived from the s-aorist
stem φθεισ-/φθῑσ: the Homeric epithets φθεισήνωρ and φθισίμβροτος ‘destroying
men’, and the much later φθισίφρων ‘destroying the mind’ (Opp.). In the other
three compounds derived from this verb, all of mostly poetic attestation, the FC
derives from the present stem and, exceptionally, retains the -ν- infix. The struc-
ture of these compounds too is different, in that the FC modifies the SC and the
meaning of the compound seems to be either possessive (φθινόκαρπος ‘having
lost its fruits’, φθινόκωλος ‘with wasting limbs’) or determinative (φθινόπωρον
‘autumn’ is the waining of ὀπώρα ‘summer’). As noted above in relation to com-
pounds in μ(ε)ιξο-, this ‘determinative’ structure is often associated with the use
of the linking vowel -o-.
4.5 Class I: summary
The analysis of Class I reveals that the creation of V1 compounds derived from
verbs which do not produce V2 compounds was a widespread phenomenon
in Greek. These V1 forms are attested in both the appellative and onomastic
domains, a fact which rules out the hypothesis that mere stylistic requirements
govern their creation. There is a good deal of correspondence between literary
and onomastic compounds (those derived from ἀγαπάω, ἀμεύομαι, βρίθω, δείδω,
ἴσχω, μείγνυμι, μίσγω, ῥίπτω, τανύω), but families represented only by PNs also
exist (section 4.2).
     I have suggested that the orientation of these compounds owes much to the
impossibility of creating a V2 counterpart from the same roots. In this case, then,
the V1 pattern is not simply a stylistically marked construction, but a morpholog-
ical device. This kind of morphological supplementation was established already
in the earliest stages of Greek: most of the compounds belonging to this group
are Archaic or Classical, and the number of newly emerging compound families
in the post-Classical age is limited (see compounds derived from ἀμέρδω, λήγω
and σχήσω).
     Our in-depth analysis of these families has also highlighted their tendency
to be associated with the poetic register and to be of low productivity. The sug-

gestion in sections 4 and 4.1 was that there may be a correlation between the low
productivity of the compounds derived from ἀάω, ἀγαπάω, ἀμέρδω, ἀμεύομαι,
βρίθω, εἰλέω, ἐλελίζω, ἐρείπω, κέκασμαι, μίσγω, στυγέω and χρέμπτομαι and
the fact that their base verbs are comparatively rare in Greek. On the whole, the
base verbs and compounds uniquely attested in onomastics (section 4.2) are also
characterized by a low productivity: the exceptions are ἁνδάνω, λαγχάνω and
τυγχάνω, all common Greek verbs.
     In section 4.3 we considered some common verbs whose compounds are
nevertheless of limited productivity: in this subgroup too we noted that the
compounds tend to feature in poetic texts. Out of forty-two compound families
in Class I, only eight comprise more than four items, but most of the individual
forms are of limited productivity (section 4.4). There is a tendency for some FCs to
develop adjectival semantics, and when this is the case the FC forsakes the typical
markers -ε- and -σι- and acquires a different shape (μ(ε)ιξο-, τανυ-, φθινο-). These
structural characteristics may explain why these three compound families are the
most productive in Class I as a whole: as we shall see apropos of compounds
in ἐθελο-, κρυψι-, μελλο- (section 5.3.1) and of those in φιλο- and ἀρχι- (Chapter
6, section 3.1), in other compound families a similar connection is to be found
between verbal FCs which behave like adjectives (or, even, quasi-prefixes) and
the high productivity of the compounds.
     In conclusion, Class I is characterized by the following properties:
– The base verbs do not belong to the types that produce agent nouns in -ος.
– The vast majority of the compound families have less than four items each.
– The vast majority of the compounds are used uniquely in poetry.
– Thirteen out of forty-two base verbs produce only onomastic compounds.
5 Class II: V1 compounds without a V2 counterpart deriving
5 from verbs which give rise to agent nouns
The group of V1 compounds which do not have a V2 counterpart but derive from
verbs which produce agent nouns comprises thirty-three families. The reasons
for the lack of a compounded form of the agent noun (a V2 compound) are not
always clear: in order to attain a better understanding of the interaction between
base verbs, agent nouns and V1 compounds, section 5.1 collects and analyses all
agent nouns derived from the verbs in this class. This analysis suggests that the
semantic specialization of a number of these agent nouns and the seemingly low
productivity of most of them are contributing factors to their exclusion from com-
pounding. Many V1 compounds derived from these verbs may therefore have been
created in response to the constraints affecting the agent nouns: section 5.3 tests

this hypothesis by studying the use and productivity of these V1 compounds,
paying special attention to what separates the more productive families (those
containing four or more individual compounds) from less common ones.
       To start off, it is useful to consider what types of verbs and stems feature in
Class II. The thirty-three verbs in question are:
αἰνέω ‘praise’, αἱρέω ‘take’, ἀκέομαι ‘heal’, ἀλέξω ‘keep off’, ἀνύω ‘accom-
plish’, ἅπτω ‘touch’, ἀράομαι ‘pray’, αὔξω ‘increase’, ἐγείρω ‘wake’, ἐθέλω ‘to
be willing’, ἐργάζομαι ‘work’, ἕρπω ‘go’, ἐρύκω ‘restrain’, ἔρυμαι ‘protect’/ἐρύω
‘drag’, εὔχομαι ‘pray’, ζεύγνυμι ‘yoke’, ἵημι ‘release, hasten’, κελεύω ‘command’,
κλαίω ‘weep’, κράζω ‘scream’, κρύπτω ‘hide’, κτάομαι ‘acquire’, μέλλω ‘be about
to’, μέλω ‘care’, ὀνίνημι ‘profit’, ὁρμάω ‘set in motion’, παύω ‘stop’, πέπᾱμαι ‘own’,
ῥήγνυμι ‘break’, ταράσσω ‘stir’, τίνω ‘avenge’, τρέπω ‘turn, twist’, χαράσσω
‘engrave’.
The morphology of these verbs has an impact on the type of agent nouns which
they produce. These verbs belong to the following types:
– Mostly full-grade thematic radical presents: ἀλέξω,27 αὔξω,28 ἐθέλω, ἕρπω,
       ἔρυμαι/ἐρύομαι (whose compounds are homonymous with those derived
       from ἐρύω, a verb of unclear etymology),29 εὔχομαι, μέλω. τρέπω shows CeC/
       CoC ablaut within its paradigm.
– Full-grade reduplicated presents: ἵημι.
– Roots which form the present with nasal infixes and suffixes: ἀνύω (in Greek
       the -νυ- suffix is extended to the whole paradigm), ζεύγνυμι, ὀνίνημι,30
       ῥήγνυμι, τίνω.
27 The root is ἀλεκ- < *h2lek-: the additional [s] is explained as a desiderative suffix (see DGE
s.v., LIV 278).
28 As in the case of ἀλέξω, the Greek present is reconstructed from the root *h2eug- (Lat. augeo)
enlarged with the suffix -s, expressing either a desiderative (DGE) or an inchoative meaning (LIV
274–275, 288–289). ἀέξω, which provides the FC to many V1 compounds, is a variant deriving
from a different and old e-grade (EDG s.v., LIV 289).
29 According to DGE, followed by EDG, ἔρυμαι ‘rescue’ is an ablauting radical present while
ἐρύω does not have a clear etymology; LIV 684–685, however, attributes both to the root *wer-,
which would yield these radical presents through an -u- enlargement. On a more recent etymology,
see Hackstein (2002: 123–131).
30 According to LIV 302, ὀνίνημι was originally an ablauting n-infix present *h3 n̥-né/n-h2- which
was remodelled to follow the pattern of reduplicated presents.

      paradigm), ταράσσω, χαράσσω.
–     -jé/ó- or -éje/o- presents which yield vocalic presents in Greek: αἰνέω, αἱρέω,33
      ἀκέομαι, ἀράομαι, κτάομαι,34 ὁρμάω.
–     Various verbs of unclear etymology or formation: ἐρύκω,35 κελεύω,36
      πέπᾱμαι,37 παύω.38
5.1 Agent nouns from the verbs in Class II
These verbs produce various types of agent nouns, sometimes more than one
type from the same verb. The most numerous group is that of verbs which only
produce agent nouns in -της (5.1.1), followed by those in -τηρ and -τωρ (5.1.2),
while only two agent nouns in -ος are attested (5.1.3), in keeping with the low
number of ablauting roots (see the first entry in the above list). Section 5.1.4 col-
lects verbs which produce more than one type of agent noun. The combined data
of these four sections show that agent nouns in -της (analysed in 5.1.1 and 5.1.3)
are the most common type.
31 ἐργάζομαι is traditionally explained as a denominative from the agent noun ἐργάτης, itself
deriving from the plural ἔργα ‘works’ (EDG, DGE).
32 The Greek words from this root are of unclear formation. The most likely explanation is that
the present κράζω is a secondary -jé/ó- formation based on the perfect κέκραγα, and that κραγός
is the agent noun derived from the same root.
33 αἱρέω does not have an agreed etymology (cf. EDG), but it seems to have been assimilated to
-έω denominatives in the Greek verbal system.
34 The etymology is controversial. EDG assumes that the root was *tkeh1-, persisting in the
Greek forms in -η- (pf. κέκτημαι, aor. ἐκτησάμην) and that the present is a later analogical for-
mation. LIV 619 n. 1, on the other hand, posits a root *tek-: its zero grade *tk- would yield the
feminine noun *tk-eh2-, from which κτάομαι would derive as a denominative.
35 According to EDG, this verb is formed from the same root yielding ἔρυμαι with the aid of a κ
enlargement.
36 The formation of κελεύω is not clear: the verb derives from the same root as κέλλω and
κέλομαι ‘command’, but the use of the -ευ- suffix, which normally characterizes denominal for-
mations such as παιδέυω and βασιλεύω, is extraordinary: see EDG s.v.
37 The reduplicated formation may well be the original one, but all derived nominal formations
have the radical long syllable πᾱ, which is also used in the FC πασι-.
38 DGE takes the present as the starting point and tentatively posits a -jé/ó- present *paw-jé/ó-;
LIV 462, followed by EDG, tentatively reconstructs the root *peh2u-, which gives rise to the s-aorist
ἔπαυσα as its primary formation.

5.1.1 -της agent nouns
In chronological order of first attestation:
τίνω ‘avenge’ > τίτᾱς ‘avenger’ (Aesch.; at Gortyn, a magistrate who inflicted
fines). This agent noun is attested only twice.39
μέλλω ‘to be about to’ > μελλητής ‘one who has a hesitating character’ (Thuc.).
μελλητής is first used by Thucydides in a famous passage of book 1.70 in which
the Corinthians contrast the Athenians’ virtues (including the ability to make
swift decisions) with the Spartans’ conservatism: καὶ μὴν καὶ ἄοκνοι πρὸς ὑμᾶς
μελλητάς (‘Moreover, [the Athenians] are prompt [in decision], while you are dil-
atory’). As in the Thucydides passage, the tendency in other sources too is to use
μελλητής either in contrast to adjectives expressing the idea of ‘swift’ or in con-
junction with terms derived from ὄκνος ‘hesitation’. In Aristotle’s profile of the
great-souled man (ὁ μεγαλόψυχος) at Nicomachean Ethics 1124b.17–26, he states
that it is characteristic of this man not to occupy places of honour and go where
other people take the first place, but to be idle and procrastinate (καὶ ἀργὸν εἶναι
καὶ μελλητὴν) except when pursuing high honours or achievements. Much later,
Philo uses μελλητής as often as six times, three times in conjunction with ὄκνος
or ὀκνηρός;40 the same pair (ὀκνηρός and μελλητής) is used by Dio Cassius (Ant.
rom. 214.11) in a passage where he translates Fabius Cunctator’s agnomen into
Greek, and by John Chrysostomus. μελλητής was probably considered to be a
good Attic word, acceptable in learned speech: we gain this impression from the
fact that it is discussed four times in Pollux’ Onomasticon. Its semantics is closer
to an adjective than to an agent noun.
πέπ̄μαι ‘own’ > πάστᾱς ‘owner’ (Crete, fifth c. BC).
This rare agent noun is only attested in the Gortyn laws.
ῥήγνυμι ‘break’ > ῥήκτης ‘breaker’ (Aristot.).
Contrary to its meaning, in Aristot. De mundo 396a.5 this agent noun is not used
to indicate ‘someone who breaks’ but rather a kind of earthquake: οἱ δὲ χάσματα
ἀνοίγοντες καὶ τὴν γῆν ἀναρρηγνύντες ῥῆκται καλοῦνται (‘[earthquakes] which
open up chasms and break the earth are called breakers’). The same meaning
is attested in Posidonius, Stobaeus and Lydus in passages dealing with earth-
quakes. This agent noun was therefore a technical word.
39 Another form, ἀτίτης ‘unpunished, unhonoured’, is formed like an agent noun, but has the
semantics of the verbal adjective ἄτιτος.

234          Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
αἰνέω ‘praise, advise’ > αἰνετής ‘one that praises’ (Hdn. Partitiones 34.7 Bois-
sonade = Eust. in Od. 1.152.46; Greg. Naz. De vita sua 814).
A very rare agent noun, which does not seem to have existed in Classical Greek.
ἐγείρω ‘rouse, raise’ > ἐγέρτης ‘one who rouses’ (Hdn.).
This agent noun is attested in two very similar passages containing lists of words
in Herodian’s Περὶ καθολικῆς προσῳδίας (3.1.77.25 Lentz) and Περὶ ὀρθογραφίας
(3.2.423.20 Lentz) which illustrate issues of accentuation and phonology; its
meaning is not stated. As is usually the case with Herodian’s work, we cannot
be sure that the fragments are all original; be that as it may, it is worth noting
that ἐγέρτης is not attested elsewhere, except in its late prefixed form ἐξεγέρτης
‘one who arouses’ (PGM 12.225). The only V2 compound formed with this agent
noun, νεκρεγέρτης, appears in the late Byzantine age, in line 239 of the Christus
Patiens (whose attribution to Gregory of Nazianzus is now considered errone-
ous): whatever its origin, the first attestation of this form is obviously too late
for it to constitute a genuine alternative to Classical V1 compounds derived from
ἐγείρω.
εὔχομαι ‘pray’ > εὐχέτης ‘one who prays’ (Hdn.).
In the Partitiones attributed to Herodian (165.17 Boissonade = Eust. in Od. 1.83.9)
εὐχέτης appears in a list of words ending in -έτης and is not glossed; as with most
of Herodian’s work, evidence that might allow a secure dating of the material
that has reached us under his name is scarce. This attestation aside, all other
instances of εὐχέτης are found in Byzantine texts.
αἱρέω ‘take, seize’ > αἱρέτης ‘one who chooses; favourer’ (Vett. Val.); also used in
the specialized meaning of ‘searcher of archives’ in POxy 1654.7 (second c. AD).
This agent noun is sporadically attested in Greek. In POxy 1654, an account of
payments to various persons, it is followed by ἡγεμονικῆς βιβλιοθήκης ‘prefect’s
library’ and likely indicates the person in charge of producing documents after
a search (a function usually expressed by the prefixed form προαιρέτης). In
Vett. Val. 2.1, αἱρέτης is followed by ἀγαθῶν: its meaning in context seems to be
‘procurer of good things’.41
αὔξω ‘increase’ > αὐξητής ‘increaser’ (Orph. H.).
This form features among the titles of Pan in Orph. H. 11.11 and of Zeus in Orph.
H. 15.8.
41 On both contexts, see Grenfell and Hunt ad POxy 1654.

ἀνύω ‘accomplish’ > ἀνυτής ‘tax-collector’ (Just.).
This agent noun is attested only in late-antique Greek as a translation of the Latin
term exactor.
The nouns in this list are ten in total and are attested mostly in post-Classical
Greek for the first time. In terms of semantics, πάστᾱς, αἰνετής, ἐγέρτης, εὐχέτης
and αὐξητής convey the general verbal idea expressed by the base verbs, while
the remaining ones seem to have acquired a specialized meaning, restricting the
semantic sphere of the verb and identifying specific types of individuals or things:
μελλητής is not just someone who hesitates to do something, but a hesitating
person tout court, and ῥήκτης is the name of a type of earthquake. Specialized agent
nouns often provide names for professions or officials: this is the case with τίτᾱς
(a magistrate at Gortyn), αἱρέτης (searcher of archives) and ἀνυτής (tax-collector).
     In sum, it is plausible that five out of ten of these nouns in -της were exclu-
sively specialized for the expression of a restricted meaning, and this surely
limited their suitability as ingredients in the creation of V2 agentive compounds.
Together with semantic specialization, low productivity may also have played a
role in the exclusion of these agent nouns from compounding. As noted in the
comments above, the majority both of the agent nouns expressing the general
verbal idea and of the specialized agent nouns are rare and/or late: see τίτᾱς,
αἰνετής, ῥήκτης, ἐγέρτης, εὐχέτης, αἱρετής, αὐξητής and ἀνυτής (eight out of
ten). Semantic specialization and low productivity may also explain the exclu-
sion from compounding of the agent nouns that feature in the next two groups.
5.1.2 -τηρ and -τωρ agent nouns
In chronological order of first attestation:
ἀλέξω ‘protect’ > ἀλεξητήρ ‘protector’ (Hom.), ἀλκτήρ ‘one who wards off’ (ibid.)
ἀλεξήτωρ ‘protector’ (Soph.).
ἀλεξητήρ and its feminine form ἀλεξήτειρα are rare words, which continue to
be used down to Byzantine Greek but are also glossed in lexicographical works
(Σ, Photius, EM) on account of their rarity. ἀλεξήτωρ is only attested in Sopho-
cles, Apoll. Gramm. and the scholia. ἀλκτήρ, which employs the zero-grade root
behind the thematic aorist ἀλαλκεῖν, features in various poetic works, but was
probably not common, since it is often glossed in lexicographical works.
ἀράομαι ‘pray, invoke’ > ἀρητήρ ‘one that prays, priest’ (Hom.).
Most of the post-Homeric attestations of this agent noun feature in discussions of
poetic language and echo Il. 1.11, where ἀρητήρ is used in apposition to Chryses.

The word had a clear poetic status, reflected in Arist. Po. 1457b.33–35: πεποιημένον
δ’ ἐστὶν ὃ ὅλως μὴ καλούμενον ὑπὸ τινῶν αὐτὸς τίθεται ὁ ποιητής, δοκεῖ γὰρ ἔνια
εἶναι τοιαῦτα, οἷον τὰ κέρατα ἔρνυγας καὶ τὸν ἱερέα ἀρητῆρα (‘An invented word
is one absolutely not used by any people and coined by the poet. There seem to
be such words, e.g. ‘sprouters’ for horns and ‘prayer’ for priest’). This agent noun
was rare and limited to poetic registers.
ἅπτω ‘touch’ > ἐφάπτωρ ‘one who touches or caresses’ (Aesch.).
There are no simple agent nouns derived from ἅπτω, but the existence of the
compounded form ἐφάπτωρ shows that the word formation pattern was pos-
sible. ἐφάπτωρ, however, does not seem to have been a productive word. It is
only attested several times in Aeschylus’ Supplices, where it is one of a number
of derivatives of ἐφάπτω playing with the name of Epaphus, the ancestor of the
Danaids, whom the maidens portray as having been conceived by the mere touch
of Zeus.
χαράσσω ‘sharpen, scratch, carve’ > χαρακτήρ ‘engraver’ (Eur.) but also
‘impressed mark’ (Eur.) and from this literal meaning > ‘distinctive mark, char-
acter of a person’.
χαρακτήρ is frequently used with the meanings ‘mark’ and ‘character’, but the
simple agentive meaning ‘engraver’ is rare.
κτάομαι ‘acquire’ > κτήτωρ ‘possessor’ (D. S.).
The agent noun remains productive until the sixth century AD.
ἐρύκω ‘keep in, restrain’ > ἐρυκτήρ ‘class of Spartan freedmen’ (Myro Hist.).
Myro’s fragment is quoted by Athenaeus (6.102) and there are no other attesta-
tions.
ὀνίνημι ‘profit’ > ὀνήτωρ ‘bringing benefits’ (Gal.).
This agent noun is first securely attested in Galen as the name of a special plaster,
but its glossing in Hesychius as ὄνησιν φέρων ‘bringing benefit’ shows that it
could also convey a more general meaning. The two earlier attestations registered
in LSJ are based on conjectures not unanimously accepted. This agent noun is
also used as a PN.
κλαίω ‘cry, lament’ > κλαυστήρ ‘weeper’ (Manetho).
This agent noun is a hapax.

                             5 Class II: V1 compounds without a V2 counterpart        237
This group contains six agent nouns in -τηρ (ἀλεξητήρ, ἀλκτήρ, ἀρητήρ,
χαρακτήρ, ἐρυκτήρ, κλαυστήρ) and four in -τωρ (ἀλεξήτωρ, ὀνήτωρ, ἐφάπτωρ
and κτήτωρ). As in the previous group, some nouns convey a general verbal idea:
these are ἀλεξητήρ, ἀλεξήτωρ, ἐφάπτωρ, κτήτωρ, κλαυστήρ and ὀνήτωρ (six
out of ten). Of these, only ἀλεξητήρ is securely an archaic form. ἀλεξήτωρ and
ἐφάπτωρ are first attested in Classical Greek, but are very rare. κλαυστήρ is a
hapax. ἐφάπτωρ is a special case in that its attestations are all closely linked
to the web of etymologies spun by Aeschylus in the Supplices and one may well
wonder how common the form was in Greek. The only productive agent noun
appears to have been κτήτωρ ‘possessor’.
     Three of the ten forms are semantically specialized. The most ancient,
ἀρητήρ, wavers between conveying the general idea of its base verb (‘one who
prays’) and indicating a special kind of individual who prays, i.e. the priest.
χαρακτήρ, on the other hand, encompasses a large number of meanings, ranging
from the general—and much rarer—‘engraver’ to the more specialized ‘mark’ and
‘character’, which also manifest an extraordinary passive meaning (semantically,
they are nomina rei actae). Such a narrowing down of the sphere to which the
agent noun applies is more evident in ἐρυκτήρ, a Spartan technical term.
     The agent nouns in this group thus seem to have been less semantically
specialized than those in the previous one, but again they are mostly rare forms
and are often associated with poetic registers. κτήτωρ aside, none of the forms
expressing general verbal meanings appear to have been productive in Greek.
5.1.3 Verbs producing agent nouns in -ος
τρέπω ‘turn, change’ > τροπός ‘twisted leathern thong’ (Hom.).
This is the paradigm of a formally agentive noun which becomes specialized as an
instrument noun: the τροπός (literally ‘turner’) was a strap by means of which the
oar was fastened to the thole. The numerous compounds in -τροπος are mostly
bahuvrihis indicating a person with a kind of ‘manner’, derived from the nomen
rei actae τρόπος: e.g. ἑτερότροπος ‘of different sort’ (Aesch.), δύστροπος ‘ill-con-
ditioned’ (Eur.). In the few examples in which -τροπος seems to have an agen-
tive meaning, the compound has a prepositional FC (παλίντροπος ‘turning back’,
Soph.). This leaves only the name of the sun-flower, ἡλιότροπος (with its more
common diminutive ἡλιοτρόπιον) as a likely, though not perfect, V2 compound
roughly meaning ‘turning with the sun’. These data suggest that strong semantic
pressure from τρόπος ‘manner’, paired with the specialized meaning of τροπός
‘leathern thong’, inhibited the formation of a productive class of compounds in
-τροπος with a clear verbal meaning.

5.1.4 Verbs giving rise to more than one type of agent noun
In alphabetical order:
ἔρυμαι ‘heal’ > ἀκέστωρ ‘healer, saviour’ (Eur.), ἀκεστήρ ‘healer’ (Soph.),
ἀκεστής ‘mender, healer’ (Xen.).
At Euripides Andromache 900 ἀκέστωρ is used as an epithet of Apollo. Subse-
quently it is mostly attested as a PN, returning at a later date in Gregory of Nazian-
zus and Paulus Silentiarius. ἀκεστήρ is a Sophoclean hapax, while ἀκεστής
appears in the Cyropaedia with the meaning ‘mender’ and is later used by Lyco-
phron as an epithet of Chalcas. Apparently in light of its use and meaning in Xen-
ophon, ἀκεστής is recommended by Phrynichus Ecl. 64 against ̓πητής ‘mender’,
which is also a much rarer word.
ἐθέλω ‘to be willing’ > ἐθελοντήρ ‘volunteer’ (Hom.), ἐθελοντής ‘volunteer’
(Hdt.), θελητής ‘one who wills’ (LXX).
ἐθελοντήρ and ἐθελοντής are formed from the participle stem ἐθελοντ-, which
also features in the adverb ἐθελοντήν ‘voluntarily’. ἐθελοντήρ is very rare (it
is basically a Homeric hapax, which is later commented upon three times in
lexicographical works), while ἐθελοντής is a common form. θελητής ‘one who
wills’ (LXX) is mostly attested in Christian authors and is not very common (it
acquires a compounded form in ecclesiastical Byzantine Greek, μωνοθελητής,
indicating an adherer to the sect that believed that Christ had two natures but
only one will).
ἐργάζομαι ‘work’ > ἐργάτης (Archil.), ἐργαστήρ (Xen.), ἐργαστής (A.D.), all ‘work-
man’.
ἐργάτης (probably deriving from ἔργα: see note 31) is a very common agent
noun in Greek; it continues to be used down to Late Antiquity and survives into
MG, later providing the SC for a number of V2 compounds which in Byzantine
Greek replace those in -ουργός (e.g. ἀμπελουργός ‘vine-dresser’ : ἀμπελεργάτης,
Manass.). These forms are never attested in AG authors, however.
     ἐργαστής, which is morphologically more correct since it preserves the full
stem ἐργαδ- > ἐργασ-, is found only in grammatical sources (Apollonius Dyscolus,
Herodian, Orion) which address its relationship with ἐργάτης. ἐργαστήρ is even
rarer: used once by Xenophon, it is later discussed by Pollux with quotations
from Xenophon, and it features also in Claudius Aelianus and Stobaeus.

                              5 Class II: V1 compounds without a V2 counterpart       239
ἕρπω ‘move, go’ > ἑρπηστής ‘a reptile’ (Nic.), ἑρπηστήρ ‘creeping thing, reptile’
(Opp.).
The agent nouns derived from this verb, which expresses a kind of slow movement
associated with certain beasts, are generally used as generic terms for ‘reptile’ or
other animals which creep (guinea worms, mice, etc.).
ἔρυμαι/ἐρύω ‘rescue, draw, drag off’ > ῥυτήρ ‘one who draws, rein; defender’
(both meanings Hom.), ῥύτωρ ‘defender; stretcher’ (both meanings Aesch.),
ῥύστης ‘saviour’ (LXX), ἐρυτήρ ‘drawer’ (Nic.). The semantic range of these agent
nouns reflects that of the homophonous base verbs.
ῥυτήρ is used until Late Antiquity, while ῥύτωρ dies out in the Hellenistic age,
and is later attested mostly in lexicographical works. ῥύστης, on the other hand,
makes its first appearance in the Septuagint but continues to be used down to
the sixth century AD. After Nicander, ἐρυτήρ features only in grammatical and
lexicographical sources.
ζεύγνυμι ‘yoke’ > ζευκτήρ (Jos.), ζευκτής (Hsch.): both ‘one who yokes’.
Its first attestation in Josephus aside, ζευκτήρ is found only three other times in
lexicographical sources. ζευκτής is a hapax.
ἵημι ‘release’ > ἀφέτης ‘one who lets off a military engine’ (Plb.), ἀφετήρ ‘starting
point’ (Iambl.).
These preverbed formations show that, from a morphological point of view, ἵημι
creates agent nouns. However, ἵημι is a full member of Class II in that there are
no V2 compounds which derive from the simple verb ἵημι. ἀφέτης itself creates
determinative compounds, such as Σαλαμιναφέτης ‘betrayer of Salamis’ (Sol.),
γαστραφέτης ‘stomach-bow’ (Hero), καταπαλταφέτης ‘artillery-man’ (Phil.
Mech.), ἀνεμαφέτης ‘wind-releaser’ (PGM 14.1363), ἰαφέτης ‘archer’ (AP 9.525.10).
κελεύω ‘order’ > κελευστής ‘one who gives the time to rowers’ (Eur.), κελεύστωρ
‘one who commands’ (Phryn.).
κελευστής is often found in Classical Greek, though it remains a specialized term.
The general verbal idea, however, is conveyed by κελεύστωρ, as Phrynichus
notes in the Praeparatio sophistica 81.1.3 (the only source to attest to the existence
of this word): κελεύστωρ διαφέρει τοῦ κελευστής. ὁ μὲν γὰρ κελευστής ἐστιν ὁ
ἐν νηῒ κελεύων τοῖς ἐρέταις τι, ὁ δὲ κελεύστωρ ὁ ἐπικελευόμενος καὶ παρορμῶν
‘κελεύστωρ is different from κελευστής. For the κελευστής is the person who
gives orders to rowers in a boat, whereas the κελεύστωρ is someone who exhorts
and incites’.

240         Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
κράζω ‘bawl’ > κεκράκτης ‘bawler’ (Hippocr.), κράκτης ‘bawler’ (Aristoph.),
κραγός ‘bawling’ (Aristoph.).
Both κεκράκτης and κράκτης have a dozen attestations in total. κραγός is attested
only once in Aristophanes and then mostly in lexicographical works. Quite apart
from the low productivity of these agent nouns, the issue of the relationship
between V1 and V2 compounds from this verb must be discussed in relation to
the context in which most of these forms occur, Aristophanic comedy (see section
5.3.2).
κρύπτω ‘hide’ > κρύπτης ‘member of the Spartan corps called κρυπτεία’ (Eur.?),
κρυπτήρ ‘convenient for concealing’ (Sch. Opp.).
Both words are hapax legomena. κρύπτης is currently edited as Euripides fr. 1126
Nauck, but its attribution to Euripides is even dubious: the scholia to Aristoph.
Thesm. 600 in codex R, commenting on the verbal adjective κρυπτός add, some-
what inconsequentially, that καλοῦνται μὲν γὰρ καὶ κρύπται παρὰ Πλάτωνι τῷ
φιλοσόφῳ καὶ παρ’ Εὐριπίδͅ καὶ ἐν ταῖς Λακεδαιμονίων πολιτείαις (which roughly
translates as ‘κρύπται are also mentioned in Plato the philosopher, in Euripides
and in the constitutions of the Spartans’), but already Dindorf suspected that the
reference to Euripides was out of place and suggested replacing his name with
Aristotle’s.42 The first attestation of κρύπτης may therefore be slightly later than
assumed.
μέλω ‘care’ > μελέτωρ ‘one who cares for, avenger’ (Soph.), μελητής ‘one who is
in charge’ (Eust.).
μελέτωρ is a hapax in Sophocles, later glossed in the Suda; μελητής is a rare
word, without attestation before the Byzantine age (it is not present in LSJ).
ὁρμάω ‘set in motion’ > ὁρμητής ‘imperious person’ (Philostr. Jun.) and ‘someone
ready to strike’ (Philostr.), ὁρμάστειρα ‘one who urges on’ (Orph. H.).
ὁρμητής appears late in Greek and is rarely attested. The feminine ὁρμάστειρα is
a hapax, used as an epithet of Athena in Orph. H. 32.9 (corrected into ὁρμήτειρα
by Abel).
παύω ‘stop’ > παυστήρ (Soph.), παύστωρ both ‘one who stops’ (Isyll.).
Both are rare forms: παυστήρ is attested twice in Sophocles and once in Alexis
(the latter quoted by Athenaeus 10.71), while παύστωρ is a hapax.

ταράσσω ‘stir, trouble’ > ταράκτωρ (Aesch.) and ταράκτης (Lycophr.) both ‘dis-
turber’.
Both these agent nouns are rare and poetic: they have one attestation each in AG,
while the others all occur in Byzantine texts (Psellus, Eusthatius, etc.).
This group, comprising sixteen nouns in -της (ἀκεστής, ἐθελοντής, θελητής,
ἐργάτης, ἐργαστής, ἑρπηστής, ῥύστης, ἀφέτης, ζευκτής, κελευστής, κεκράκτης,
κράκτης, κρύπτης, μελητής, ὁρμητής, ταράκτης), ten in -τηρ (ἀκεστήρ,
ἐθελοντήρ, ἐργαστήρ, ἑρπηστήρ, ῥυτήρ, ἐρυτήρ, ἀφετήρ, ζευκτήρ, ὁρμάστειρα,
παυστήρ), six in -τωρ (ἀκέστωρ, ῥύτωρ, κελεύστωρ, μελέτωρ, παύστωρ, ταρά-
κτωρ) and one in -ος (κραγός), is more mixed than the previous three. Not only
does the productivity and semantic use of individual agent nouns vary greatly,
but the various agent nouns derived from the same verb can also have signifi-
cantly different meanings. Those agent nouns which express the general verbal
action are: all the agent nouns derived from ἀκέομαι, ἐργάζομαι, ἐρύμαι/ἐρύω,
ζεύγνυμι and παύω; and θελητής and κελεύστωρ.
     Outside this majority, we find a number of agent nouns which have become
specialized. This is the case with ἑρπηστής and ἑρπηστήρ ‘reptile’, κελευστής
‘one who gives the time to rowers’, κρύπτης ‘member of the κρυπτεία’ and
ὁρμητής ‘imperious person’. ἐθελοντήρ and ἐθελοντής also appear to have more
restricted semantics than the base verbs and are seemingly close to being adjec-
tives. As already argued in connection with the previous three groups, semantic
specialization is likely to have prevented the formation of V2 compounds.
     As concerns the other agent nouns, which lack specialized semantics, we
may note that thirteen forms are first attested in the post-Classical age: ἀφέτης
(Plb.), ἀφετήρ (Iambl.), ἐργαστής (A.D.), ἑρπηστήρ (Nic.) and ἑρπηστής (Opp.),
θελητής (LXX), ῥύστης (LXX), ἐρυτήρ (Nic.), ζευκτήρ (Jos.), ζευκτής (Hsch.),
κελεύστωρ (Phryn.), κρυπτήρ (Sch. Opp.), μελητής (Eust.), ὁρμητής (Philostr.
Jun.), ὁρμάστειρα (Orph. H.), παύστωρ (Isyll.) and ταράκτης (Lycophr.). There is
an even larger number of rare forms, adding up to eighteen: ἀκεστήρ (hapax),
ἐθελοντήρ, ζευκτήρ, ζευκτής (hapax), θελητής, ῥύτωρ, ἐρυτήρ, κελεύστωρ
(hapax), κρύπτης and κρυπτήρ (both hapax legomena), μελέτωρ (hapax),
ὁρμητής and ὁρμάστειρα (hapax), παυστήρ and παύστωρ (hapax), ταράκτωρ
(hapax) and ταράκτης. The lack of V2 compounds may therefore be linked to the
very low productivity of these simplicia.

5.2 Analysis of Class II
The distribution of agent nouns in the four groups above is not surprising. Given
the shape of the verbal roots involved, it was expected that the derived agent
nouns would be of the -της or -τηρ/-τωρ types, which can be created virtually out
of any verbal root, rather than of the -ος type. In general, -τηρ/-τωρ nouns are
not compoundable (cf. Chapter 2, section 6.4): in order to create a V2 compound,
they would first have to be turned into a -της form. There are no morphological
reasons why this should be impossible for the forms collected in section 5.1.2: the
fact that such agent nouns were seemingly excluded from compounding suggests
that other factors might be at work.
     A related question is why verbs which have -της agent nouns (those collected
in 5.1.1 and 5.1.4) do not produce V2 compounds: since -της agent nouns can be
formed on any verbal root (Chapter 2, 6.4.2), the creation of V2 compounds based
on them should always be possible. It follows that the lack of such compounds
(or, for that matter, of simple agent nouns) may simply be due to chance and to
the state of our documentation. In particular, it is not clear why pairs of verb/
agent noun such as αὔξω/αὐξητής (‘increase’/‘increaser’) or ἐργάζομαι/ἐργάτης
(‘work’/‘worker’) should not produce V2 compounds in Classical Greek. However,
this line of argument, which can never be dismissed when languages no longer
spoken are under investigation, does not exempt us from searching for further
possible factors in the lack of V2 compounds derived from certain verbal roots.
     Another look at the above lists of agent nouns prompts two observations. The
first concerns the productivity of the attested forms. As concerns -της agent nouns,
we saw that τίτᾱς, πάστᾱς, αἰνετής, ῥήκτης, ἐγέρτης, εὐχέτης, ζευκτής, αἱρέτης,
αὐξητής, ἀνυτής (5.1.1) and θελητής, μελητής, ὁρμητής and ταράκτης (5.1.4) are
all rare, sometimes only attested once or twice in the whole of Greek. Among the
nouns in -τηρ and -τωρ, a category which progressively wanes in post-Classical
Greek, rare forms are more common and include ἀλεξητήρ, ἐρυκτήρ, κλαυστήρ,
ἀκεστήρ, ἐθελοντήρ, ῥύτωρ, ἐρυτήρ, ζευκτήρ, κελεύστωρ, κρυπτήρ, μελέτωρ,
ὀνήτωρ, ὁρμάστειρα, παυστήρ and παύστωρ. These add up to two thirds of the
total.
     The second, and crucial, observation concerns the semantics of many of
these simplicia. As noted in the analyses, in a number of cases the agent noun
does not convey a general verbal idea, but has a more specialized usage: thus, for
instance, αἱρέτης is not simply ‘one who takes’ but ‘one who produces documents
at the end of a search’, a ‘searcher of archives’; ἀνυτής is the Greek translation of
the Latin term exactor; μελλητής is not ‘someone about to do something’ (which
would permit the use of a nominal FC), but ‘one who has a hesitating charac-
ter’; the ῥήκτης is a type of earthquake; ἐρυκτήρ designates a ‘class of Spartan

freedmen’; χαρακτήρ mostly indicates a mark or character. Such semantic spe-
cialization suggests that a compound form of the agent noun would not convey
a general verbal idea, but would represent a subtype of the specialized meaning
expressed by the agent noun.
     Semantic specialization may also account for the lack of compounds derived
from the agent nouns listed in 5.1.4, in which nouns in -τηρ/-τωρ alternate with
those in -της: the latter are the only ones which, as a rule, can be compounded.
If the -της simplicia from the same verbs have acquired a specialized meaning,
compounds derived from these -τηρ/-τωρ simplicia would look like compounded
forms of the semantically specialized nouns in -της. This may be the reason why
such -της compounds are never attested.
     This can be illustrated by considering the pair of agent nouns derived from
κρύπτω ‘hide’. The generic verbal meaning is conveyed by κρυπτήρ ‘convenient
for concealing’, while the -της agent noun κρύπτης has acquired the very specific
sense of ‘member of the Spartan κρυπτεία’. Similarly, while κελεύστωρ ‘one who
commands’ expresses a generic verbal idea, κελευστής—the form which could
be used in compounding—is specialized as ‘one who gives the time to rowers’: its
compound forms would arguably convey the same semantic notion. As concerns
the remaining agent nouns, there are no clear semantic reasons or productivity
factors which provide a good explanation for the exclusion from compounding of
e.g. θελητής ‘one who wills’, ἀκεστής ‘healer’, ἁρπακτής ‘robber’, etc.
5.3 The V1 compounds in Class II
The above analysis has suggested that many of the V1 compounds derived from
verbs in this group were created because the semantic restrictions and limited
productivity of the agent nouns prevented the creation of transparent or prolific
V2 compounds. It is now time to analyse the thirty-three V1 compounds in Class
II in order to observe their use and productivity. The material is divided into two
subgroups, arranged according to the base verb. The first subgroup contains
nineteen productive compound families, i.e. families with four compounds or
more, with each of the individual items having a relatively high level of produc-
tivity. The second subgroup contains fourteen compound families of low produc-
tivity which are often restricted to the onomastic domain. The reader is invited to
consult the Corpus for full details on individual families and forms.

244         Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
5.3.1 Productive V1 compound families (four items or more)
αἰνέω
This verb only creates onomastic compounds, and these are quite productive and
attested from the sixth century BC onwards. In this case the choice of the V1 struc-
ture depends on two factors: the onomastic tendency to prefer V1 compounds
over V2 compounds in -της, and the fact that the agent noun αἰνετής is a very rare
and seemingly late form (see section 5.1.1 above).
ἀκέομαι
Both onomastic and appellative compounds are attested from the late fifth
century onwards. The meaning of the FCs of these forms is quite patently ‘healer’:
see the unambiguous cases of the PNs  ̓Ακέσανδρος and  ̓Ακεσίμβροτος (‘one who
heals men’), and the epithet ἀκεσσίπονος ‘healing toil’ in Nonnus (according to
some editors anticipated by ἀκεσσίνοσος ‘healing disease’, conjectured in an
epigram by Crinagoras in AP 9.516.4). As noted above, the agent noun ἀκεστής
appears in its primary meaning of ‘healer’ for the first time in Lycophron and
mostly occurs with this meaning in lexicographical sources. Starting with Xen-
ophon (the earliest attestation of the form), ἀκεστής acquired the specialized
meaning ‘clothes-mender’, perhaps making prospective V2 compounds with a SC
-ακεστής meaning ‘healer’ impossible.
ἀλέξω
Compounds derived from this verb may be formed using the stem of the present,
but with -ι- as a linking element (by analogy with τερψίμβροτος compounds, see
Chapter 4, section 3.2); or the zero-grade root ἀλκ- (employed in the reduplicated
thematic aorist ἀλαλκεῖν), followed by the linking elements -ι-, -ε- and -εσι-.43
Compounds in ἀλεξ(ι)- are a very common type, particularly in onomastics, start-
ing with the Mycenaean form a-re-ka-sa-da-ra (Chapter 4, section 5); PNs in ἀλκι-
begin in Homer, while those in ἀλκε- and ἀλκεσι- only appear in the Hellenistic
age and are much rarer. There are no semantic reasons behind the lack of V2
compound in -αλεξητής, except perhaps that the simplex ἀλεξητήρ ‘protector’ is
itself not very productive.
ἅπτω
This verb creates both appellative and onomastic compounds based on the stem
of the sigmatic tenses. In all of these, the SC corresponds to the argument of the
verb, which is usually expressed by a genitive in Classical Greek. The mean-
43 All these FCs may show interference from ἀλκή ‘strength’.

ings range from the idea of ‘attaining’, conveyed by ἁψίκορος (‘one who attains
satiety’), to ‘touch’ proper, either in a physical manner (the PN ‘Αψιππος probably
describes the task of the person who was able to calm horses down by touching
them: cf. Xen. Eq. 6.14) or in a metaphorical sense, as in ἁψιμαχία [touch battle] >
‘skirmish’, ἁψικάρδιος ‘heart-touching’ and ἁψίμοθος [touch conflict] > ‘kindling
conflict’. As noted, the only agent noun derived from this verb is the preverbed
and rare form ἐφάπτωρ.
αὔξω/ἀέξω
V1 compounds derived from this verb are common, though mostly post-Classical.
Almost all forms are attested in poetry, starting with the first example, αἐξίγυιος
‘strengthening the limbs’, epithet of ἄεθλα ‘contests’ in Pindar. In post-Classi-
cal Greek, they feature particularly in astronomical and Orphic compositions.
Similarly, αὐξητής ‘increaser’, a very rare agent noun, is employed as an Orphic
epithet.
ἐγείρω
This productive compound family displays variation in the creation of FCs.
Archaic compounds in ἐγρε- contain the stem of the thematic aorist ἔγρεσθαι; this
is later replaced by the enlarged form ἐγρεσι- and by ἐγερσι-: the latter employs
the full-grade root ἐγερ- followed by the element -σι- and is likely to have been
influenced by the action noun ἔγερσις ‘awaking’. This direct derivation from an
action noun might explain the exclusively post-Classical attestations of the FC
ἐγερσι-. By contrast ἐγείρω has no clear derivations in the onomastic domain: the
names  ̓Εγέρτιος and  ̓Εγρετίων might be short forms deriving from compounds
with unassibilated FCs ending in -τι-, but their interpretation is not straightfor-
ward. The productivity of V1 compounds again contrasts with the fact that the
agent noun ἐγέρτης is a hapax.
ἐθέλω
This verb provides the FC to a large number of compounds, which are initially
typical of Attic prose (though the first attested compound, ἐθελόπορνος, is found
in Anacreon). As is often the case with verbal FCs ending in -o-, ἐθελο- acquires
an adjectival meaning from early on. Ἐθελοπρόξενος may be understood as a
proper verbal compound meaning ‘willing to be proxenos’, but also as ‘he who
is proxenos willingly’: accordingly, -πρόξενος would be the head and ἐθελο- its
adjectival or adverbial modification. While the verbal interpretation of ἐθελο-
applies to some of the other compounds (e.g., ἐθελοκίνδυνος ‘courting danger’
lit. ‘wanting danger’, Poll.), most of the compounds in the Corpus are ambiguous:
for instance, ἐθελόδουλος ‘serving voluntarily’, may be either ‘one who wants to

be a slave’ (V1 structure) or a ‘voluntary slave’ (determinative structure). Perhaps
because of this particular structure, the reverse V2 type, displaying ἐθελοντής in
the SC, may have been felt to yield an inadequate meaning.
ἔρυμαι/ἐρύω
ἔρυμαι ‘protect’ and ἐρύω ‘drag’ provide homophonous FCs for a number of V1
compounds, and the verb at the root of the FC can only be ascertained on the
basis of the compound’s meaning. The oldest V1 compounds build the FC from
the bare verbal root ( ̓Ερύλᾱος, probably finding a parallel in Myc. we-wa-do-ro
/Werwandros/) but already in Homeric Greek the sigmatic tenses provide an
alternative stem, and this becomes the more common option, with forms such as
ἐρυσίπτολις (Hom.) and ῥυσίπολις (Aesch.) and two Hellenistic PNs, Ἐρυσίλᾱος
and  ̓Ερύσιππος. Here the preference for the V1 structure cannot be attributed to
morphological or semantic contraints affecting the agent nouns, which are both
numerous and productive. It perhaps depends on the specialization of these
agent nouns as names or epithets of gods (see the analysis in section 5.1 above).
εὔχομαι
This common verb, used in both poetry and prose and surviving into MG (albeit
only with the meaning ‘wish, give blessing to’), does not appear to have been
productive in word formation. The agent noun εὐχέτης is only attested in gram-
matical sources; its rarity, and the consequent lack of V2 compounds, does not
seem to have been compensated for by the production of many V1 compounds.
The only examples are eight PNs, among which the FC εὐξι- is most common.
ζεύγνυμι
With the sole exception of the epithet ζευξίλεως, this verb creates only onomas-
tic compounds. The relatively low number of these forms, as compared to the
frequency of the verb, can be explained by considering the limited amount of
images which involve the action of ‘yoking’ and are suitable for PNs: one might
have expected to find ‘yoker of oxen’ side by side with Ζεύξιππος, but, unlike
the latter, this name would not carry an aristocratic or military association. As
noted, agent nouns derived from this verb are both late and very rare. The lack of
agentive V2 compounds is not offset by the existence of the type in -ζυγής, since
it remains passive throughout (the only exception being βιοζυγής ‘yoking lives
together’ in Nonnus).
κρύπτω
This compound family starts off slowly with the first attestation in Xenophon
(κρυψίνοος ‘hiding one’s thoughts’), but then becomes relatively productive in

post-Classical Greek, particularly once the FC κρυψι- becomes a sort of modifying
prefix meaning ‘secretly’ (e.g. κρυψίγονος ‘secretly born’, Orph. H.), a function
which in English the Neoclassical prefix crypto- continues to fulfil to some extent.
But while the productivity of compounds in κρυψι- was certainly fostered by this
particular structure, another incentive must have been the fact that, given the
highly specialized meaning of the agent noun κρύπτης in Spartan civic terminol-
ogy, active V2 compounds derived from this verb were probably not possible: the
rare type in -κρυφής remains passive throughout AG.44
κτάομαι
V1 compounds in κτησι- are particularly popular in onomastics and attestations
begin in the fifth century BC. The only appellative compound is the adjective
κτησίβιος ‘possessing property’ (Aesch.). Given both the general semantics of the
agent noun κτήτωρ ‘possessor’ and its productivity in post-Classical Greek, it is
not clear why there are no V2 compounds derived from this verb.
μέλλω
This family exhibits the typical features associated with compounds whose FC
ends in -o-: μελλo- has acquired a quasi-adjectival meaning, or even the role of a
prefix meaning ‘almost’, discernible in compounds such as μελλόνυμφος ‘almost
wedded’ or μελλογυμνασίαρχος ‘gymnasiarch to be, almost a gymnasiarch’. The
productivity of compounds in μελλo- depends partly on these factors, but it is
also a reflection of the specialization of the agent noun μελλητής as ‘hesitating’,
rather than ‘on the point of doing something’, which is the meaning conveyed by
the FCs of the V1 compounds. The V1 type remains productive down to the Roman
age.
μέλω
V1 compounds are mostly onomastic and identify individuals with a particular
interest in something, for instance Μελήσιππος ‘one who cares for horses, one
whose interest is in horses’, or Μελέαγρος, which was understood as ‘one who
cares for hunting’ (ἄγρα)’ but is likely to have originally contained a word for
‘weapon’, *ϝαγρος (cf. Ved. vájraḥ, Av. vazrō ‘weapon’).45 The onomastic speciali-
zation of V1 compounds and the rarity of agent nouns from μέλω are likely expla-
nations for the productivity of V1 compounds: V2 compounds in -μελής, even
44 Paliuri (2014: 54).
45 This etymology was first suggested by Delbrück, as Watkins (1995: 413) discusses in his
contribution to the understanding of Meleager’s name within the context of Indo-European
poetics.

when they acquire an active meaning, never use nominal FCs and therefore do
not constitute alternatives to the V1 type.
ὀνίνημι
The family of onomastic compounds derived from this verb is large and mirrors
the productivity of those derived from κτάομαι. This in fact is hardly surprising,
since the acquisition and possession of wealth are something which a great many
parents will wish for their child. Appellative forms on the other hand are limited
to the old compound ὀνησίπολις ‘profiting the state’ (Simon.), a hapax.
παύω
This verb constitutes a popular starting point for both onomastic and appella-
tive V1 compounds. The semantic transparency of onomastic forms is higher
than usual: see for instance the antonyms Παυσίλυπος ‘one who ends toil’ and
Παυσίχαρις (a sort of ‘Mr. Spoilsport’?) and the pair Παυσίμαχος ‘one who ends
strife’ and Παυσιπόλεμος ‘one who ends war’ (seemingly celebrating the irenic
attitudes of some individuals). There are no semantic reasons why these V1
compounds should not have competed with V2 specimina, and the lack of any
such specimina likely depends on the very low productivity of the agent nouns
παυστήρ and παύστωρ (see above).
πέπ̄μαι
This is a rare verb, but the existence of the Cretan term πάστᾱς ‘owner’ lends
support to the tentative interpretation of certain PNs beginning with Πασι- (at
least those from Doric areas) as V1 compounds derived from this root, which seem
to have an ancestor in the Mycenaen PN qa-sa-ko (= Πάσαρχος). In this respect, it
is telling that many names in Πασι- are exclusively or predominantly attested in
LGPN I, the volume containing Cretan names (see e.g. the Kurzname Πασίας and
the compounds Πασίνοος, Πάσιππος and Πασίτιμος, to mention only the most
common). Again, many other such names feature in volumes IIIa and IIIb, which
cover mostly West-Greek areas. This, coupled with the fact that only a few of these
compounded names feature in Attica (and most of them display ‘passepartout’
SCs: e.g. Πασικλῆς, Πασικράτης, Πασιμένης and Πασιτέλης), encourages the
interpretation that at least some of these names constitute V1 compounds derived
from πέπᾱμαι. However, their productivity certainly also follows from the interfer-
ence of compounds derived from πᾶς.
ῥήγνυμι
This is a popular verb in Classical Greek, but it is later replaced by ῥήσσω. Neither
of these verbs survives into MG. V1 compounds derived from ῥήγνυμι are not

numerous and are seemingly confined to the poetic lexicon: ῥηξήνωρ ‘breaking
armed ranks’ remains an epic epithet; ῥηξίχθων ‘breaking the earth, bursting
from the earth’ is attested once in Straton and later only in the Orphic Hymns
and in magical papyri as an epithet of several deities; ῥηξικέλευθος ‘opening
a path’ and ῥηξίνοος ‘breaking the wits’ are both very late forms. The PNs are
also quite uncommon: Ῥηξίβιος has only two attestations in the LGPN, while
Ῥηξίμαχος has five. The semantic specialization of ῥήκτης ‘earthquake’ made it
impossible to derive V2 compounds from it. On the other hand, the formal asso-
ciation of compounds in -ρραγής with the passive aorist ἐρράγην prevented their
transformation into a productive active type: the first active forms are ψυχορρα-
γής ‘letting the soul break loose’ (Eur.) and αἱμορραγής (Soph.), which is also
common in medical language, but this active meaning remains marginal.46
τίνω
V1 compounds are exclusively onomastic, but relatively common: the first form is
probably the Mycenaean PN qi-si-a-ko (= Τείσαρχος: see Chapter 4, sections 5 and
7.9). Many of the names can be interpreted according to meaningful patterns: the
semantics of the active τίνω ‘pay a price, acquit oneself of something’ may lurk
behind Τεισίτιμος ‘one who pays a fine’? (cf. Il. 3.289), Τεισίδικος ‘one who is con-
demned’? (cf. e.g. Soph. Aj. 113) and Τεισίπονος ‘one who repays sorrow’; while
the semantics of the middle τίνομαι ‘avenge’ may be recognized in Τεισίφονος
‘one who takes vengeance for a murder’ (cf. τείσασθαι φόνον, Il. 15.116), Τεισίβιος
‘one who takes vengeance for an act of violence’ (cf. ὄφρ’ [...] τ́σαιτο βίην, Od.
23.31) and perhaps in Τείσαρχος and Τεισικράτης, indicating individuals who
take vengeance for, or perhaps on, established powers (ἀρχή, κράτος). As noted
above, the lack of V2 compounds derived from this verb can be explained first
and foremost by reference to the rarity and semantic specialization of the agent
noun τίτᾱς, indicating an official at Gortyn, but, as in the case of other compound
families, we must also consider the possibility that the established V1 onomastic
pattern exercised some analogical pressure on the make-up of these compounds.
5.3.1.1 Summary of characteristics
One fact emerges unmistakably from the above group of nineteen verbs and com-
pounds: more than half of the V1 families in this group correspond to rare agent
nouns (those derived from αἰνέω, ἀλέξω, ἅπτω, αὔξω, ἐγείρω, εὔχομαι, ζεύγνυμι,
μέλω, ὀνίνημι, παύω and τίνω), while four more are linked to specialized agent
nouns (those derived from ἀκέομαι, μέλλω, κρύπτω and ῥήγνυμι). In the case
46 Paliuri (2014: 40–42).

250         Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
of πέπᾱμαι, moreover, we are unable to judge whether its agent noun πάστᾱς,
attested in Cretan, might have had specialist status. These numbers lend strong
support to the hypothesis outlined at the beginning of this section, namely that
oscillations in the popularity of the V1 pattern are partly dependent on the nature
of the corresponding agent nouns and on the difficulty of creating productive V2
compounds.
     In the case of the remaining verbs (ἐθέλω, ἔρυμαι/ἐρύω, κτάομαι) there seem
to have been no constraints governing the formation of agent nouns. The lack of
V2 compounds may thus be accidental. However, it is worth considering other
factors that might have contributed to the selection of the V1 over the V2 struc-
ture. One such factor is relevant only to compounds derived from ἐθέλω, which
probably developed from an original V1 type into a subclass of determinative
compounds whose FC was characterized by quasi-adjectival semantics. Another
factor is the development of specific compound families within the poetic lexicon
(see e.g. compounds derived from αὔξω, ἔρυμαι/ἐρύω and ῥήγνυμι) and/or in
onomastics (see those derived from ζεύγνυμι and κτάομαι). In these cases, ana-
logical pressure from the compound family may have contributed to perpetuating
the V1 structure, making it the preferred choice. This conclusion is also supported
by the observation that even among those verbs whose agent nouns are rare or
specialized (and for which V2 compounds were therefore more difficult to create),
uniquely or mostly onomastic families are the majority: see those derived from
αἰνέω, ἀκέομαι, ἀλέξω, ζεύγνυμι, κτάομαι, μέλω, πέπᾱμαι and τίνω, adding up to
almost half of the entire group.
5.3.2 Less productive V1 compound families
We now come to the analysis of those verbs which produce rare V1 compounds.
Most of the V1 families in this group are exclusively onomastic, while the appella-
tives among the other families are mostly rare forms.
αἱρέω
In spite of the great frequency of this verb, the compounds derived from the root
αἱρ- only amount to three: the names Αἱρήhιππος (a fifth-century Laconian form
for Αἱρήσιππος, employing the future stem) and Αἱρίππη, both conveying the same
image (‘one who seizes horses’); and the title of a play by Diphilus, αἱρησιτείχης
‘taker of walls’, which is a hapax. As already noted, V2 compounds derived from
this verb may not have been possible because of the specialized meaning of the
agent noun αἱρέτης.

                             5 Class II: V1 compounds without a V2 counterpart        251
ἀνύω
This verb, which is often used in Archaic and Classical Greek, produces very
few and late derivations. The two V1 compounds, ἀνυσίεργος ‘finishing work’
(Theocr.) and the PN  ̓Ανυσικλῆς (fourth/third c. BC), are post-Classical. Its agent
noun ἀνυτής is late-antique.
ἀράομαι
V1 compounds are limited to two PNs.  ̓Αρησίμβροτος might have a meaning
which is compatible with that of the verb (‘one who invokes mortals’ or perhaps
even ‘one who curses mortals’), but  ̓Αρήσιππος is more obscure. We should not
rule out the possibility that these may be erroneous variants of names derived
from αἱρέω (especially since both are written in the post-Euclidean alphabet,
which does not have a sign for initial aspiration). V2 compounds derived from
ἀράομαι might have been blocked by the highly literary status of the agent noun
ἀρητήρ (see 5.12). In general, the low productivity of derivations from ἀράομαι
seems to be linked to the fact that the verb is mostly poetic.
ἐργάζομαι
Derivations from this verb are limited, no doubt because of the competition from
those derived from the root ἐργ- giving rise to the present ἔρδω, which forms
the basis of a very productive family (the situation is the opposite in MG, where
forms in -ουργός have been replaced by the common type in -εργάτης: Chapter 6,
section 3.1). The existence of V1 compounds derived from ἐργάζομαι can be recon-
structed from Kurznamen beginning with Ἐργασι- (e.g. Ἐργασίων and  ̓Εργάσιλος).
The rarity of such short forms, along with the restriction of the original com-
pounds to the onomastic domain, contrasts with the frequency of the simplex
agent noun ἐργάτης. Very tentatively, we might suggest that the lack of onomastic
V2 compounds derived from ἐργάτης is connected to the semantics of this agent
noun, which does not simply indicate ‘someone who works’ but more specifically
a workman: could this meaning be felt to be inappropriate for a personal name?
ἕρπω
This was the common present formation for ‘go’ in Doric varieties. Its prevalence
in V1 compounds, however, is extremely low, perhaps because ‘go’ is an intrinsi-
cally intransitive action, whereas V1 compounds tend to have transitive seman-
tics. The only PN whose structure is unambiguous,  ̔Ερπετίδᾱμος, is one of the
very few examples of compounds in -τι- attested outside Homeric language; its
meaning can only be tentatively surmised: ‘one who goes among the people?’.
The interpretation of another PN,  ̔Ερπίνικος (Athens 255/6 AD) is more difficult
and it is not to be excluded that this is not a V1 compound from ἕρπω.

252           Chapter Five – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part I
ἐρύκω
As we have seen, the agent noun derived from this verb, ἐρυκτήρ, has the very
specialized meaning ‘type of Spartan freedman’. Because of this, the V1 pattern
was the only possible one for compounds derived from ἐρύκω. V1 compounds,
however, exhibit low productivity both in the number of different forms (only two
PNs) and in their individual attestations ( ̓Ερυξίλᾱος is attested only once, while
 ̓Ερυξίμαχος is attested five times). ἐρύκω has a poetic character.
ἵημι
This is another pervasive verb, but it only produces two PNs. The first is  ̔Ησίοδος,
the meaning of which, however, is opaque. Already Göttling (1843: xii-xiii) pro-
posed two interpretations, both of which analyse the SC as deriving from ὁδός
‘road’: the first, following EM 438, takes the compound to mean ‘he who hastens
on the road, guide’; the second takes the FC to derive from ἥδομαι and the com-
pound to mean ‘he who takes pleasure in (showing) the right road’. This last
interpretation is favoured also by Meier-Brügger (1990), who cites Thessalian
and Boeotian names in ϝασ- as likely parallels for the derivation of the FC from
ἥδομαι/ἁνδάνω. Another popular etymology derives the SC from ἀοιδή ‘song’ and
takes the compound to mean ‘he who emits songs’.47 This etymology of the SC
poses problems on a phonological level, however.48
      The interpretation of Hesiod’s name is likely to remain a topic of controversy.
Here we have opted for the derivation of the FC from ἵημι on account of its [ɛ:]:
an authentic Aeolic name derived from ἥδομαι/ἁνδάνω would have [a:] or [a]. In
order to bypass this problem Meier-Brügger (1990: 66) assumes that Hesiod, an
epic rhapsode, would have taken an Ionicized name in the Panhellenic world.
While this cannot be ruled out a priori, it also seems unnecessary: we have evi-
dence that the local dialects were mutually intelligible and did not require ‘trans-
lation’; moreover, the practice of funerary epigrams, which often forsake the local
dialect in favour of a more Panhellenic language, shows that personal names
tended to keep their dialectal phonology.
      A derivation from ἵημι is also likely for  ̔Ησίδωρος (Peloponnese?), which
could mean ‘he who throws gifts’. However, since this name is dated to the first
c. AD, the derivation of the FC from ἵημι is not beyond doubt: it could also derive
from ἥδομαι, since by this time dialectal colouring in onomastics is likely to have
waned.  ̔Ησίοχος (Athens) is similarly ambiguous: the FC may derive from ἵημι,
but also from ἥδομαι. The only appellative compound, ἡσιεπής ‘throwing words’,
47 Schulze (1892: 17 n. 3) and most recently Nagy (1999: 296–297). Subscribers to this interpretation
are listed in Meier-Brügger (1990: 63–65).

κελεύω
There are no proper V1 compounds derived from this verb, but the existence of a
type may be reconstructed from the Kurzname Κελεύσος. As noted, it is probable
that V2 compounds in -κελευστης were not created because of the semantic spe-
cialization of κελευστής ‘one who gives time to rowers’.
κλαίω
This is another verb of low productivity. The agent noun κλαυστήρ ‘weeper’ is
late, while the only V1 compound, κλαυσίμαχος (Pax 1293), is a rather artificial
Aristophanic formation designed to play with Lysimachus’ name.
κράζω
This is a special case. Derivations from this verb often display the reduplicated
stem κεκραγ-: this is the case with the agent noun κεκράκτης and the V1 com-
pound κεκραξίδαμας [bawling conquering], i.e. ‘conquering all in bawling’ (Aris-
toph. V. 596). The structure of κεκραξίδαμας is doubly artificial in that its SC
-δαμας is itself verbal. Aristophanes’ aim probably was to create a high-sounding
epithet for Cleon which reminded his audience of the language of eulogic poetry,
but whose meaning was disparaging. This aim is likely to have prompted him
to choose a V1 structure rather than a V2 compound in -κραγος. The restricted
semantics of the verb is no doubt responsible for the lack of other compounds.
ὁρμάω
There is only one compound derived from this verb, the PN  ̔Ορμᾱσίλᾱς. Its FC
may reflect the meaning of ὁρμάω as ‘rush headlong at someone’ so that the com-
pound perhaps means ‘he who rushes at the enemy’. Alternatively, the FC may
correspond to the meaning ‘incite, set in motion’, which is also reflected in the
agent noun ὁρμητής ‘imperious person’, perhaps giving us the meaning ‘he who
urges on his people’ for the compound as a whole. The impression one gains from
an analysis of this V1 compound and the two agent nouns is that ὁρμάω had a
low derivational impact, with the result that it is difficult to set clear parameters
for the comparison between the V1 compound, the agent nouns and the lack of
V2 forms.
ταράσσω
This verb expresses both physical and mental commotion and creates compounds
which closely correspond to attested phrases. ταραξικάρδιος ‘troubling the heart’

mirrors e.g. τὶς σὴν ταράσσει καρδίαν ‘who troubles your heart’ (Eur. Ba. 1321);
ταράξιππος ‘troubling horses’ corresponds to σὺν ἵππους ἐτάραξε ‘he threw into
confusion the horses’ (Il. 8.86), while ταραξιππόστρατος ‘troubling the horse-
array’ (Ar. Eq. 247), where the element ἱππο- plays with the Ἱππεῖς of the title, is
a comic extension of the latter. These compounds may also be influenced by the
action noun τάραξις ‘commotion’.
τρέπω
This is a common verb which, however, has a low rate of productivity as con-
cerns verbal compounds. As noted in section 3.2, compounds ending in -τροπος
are semantically related to the nomen rei actae τρόπος ‘manner’: there are no V2
agentive compounds in -τροπος, probably because the old agent noun τροπός has
become a technical term for a kind of strap. For this reason, one would expect V1
compounds to have been productive: instead, there is only one such compound,
τρεψίχρως ‘changing colour’ (Aristot.), which may have been coined for the pur-
poses of scientific communication.
χαράσσω
V1 compounds are limited to the poetic hapax χαραξίποντος ‘carving the sea’,
used by Simonides as the epithet of a ship. As noted in section 5.1.2, the creation
of V2 forms may have been prevented by the fact that the agent noun χαρακτήρ
was provided with specialized meanings (‘mark’, ‘character’, etc.).
5.3.2.1 Summary of characteristics
This group is different from the previous in that it contains fourteen V1 compound
families with low or extremely low productivity. This allows little scope for ana-
lysing their chronological development, and hence for drawing firm conclusions
concerning their existence vis-à-vis the lack of V2 compounds derived from the
same verbs. Again, the numbers suggest that there is a strong correlation between
a specialized or rare agent noun, the lack of V2 compounds, and the existence of
V1 compounds: this applies to forms derived from αἱρέω, ἀνύω, ἐρύκω, εὔχομαι,
κελεύω, κλαίω, ταράσσω and χαράσσω, i.e. more than half of the whole group.
     When agent nouns are more productive, and V2 compounds therefore a pos-
sibility, we find that the V1 compounds are typically rare poetic forms or even
one-off formations: see those derived from κλαίω and κράζω, which are Aristo-
phanic inventions of a highly artificial character. As in Class I, uniquely or mostly
onomastic compounds are predominant: see the compounds derived from αἱρέω,
ἐργάζομαι, ἕρπω, ἐρύκω, εὔχομαι and κελεύω.

6 V2 counterpart 6             Class III: V1 compounds with an intransitive or passive V2 counterpart
Before tackling the vast number of V1 compounds which correspond to a V2 type
in the next chapter, it will be useful to conclude the investigation of V1 com-
pounds without a V2 counterpart by briefly focusing on a smaller class of verbs
(Class III in the Corpus). These are all CeC/CoC ablauting verbs producing either
preverbed -ος formations which are characterized by an intransitive meaning
(e.g. παράμονος ‘steadfast’ from παραμένω), or by a passive meaning (e.g. μετήο-
ρος ‘lifted off the ground’, from μεταίρω). Thus, although Greek created -ος
formations from these verbal roots, in each case the semantics of the verb seems
to have prevented the formation of active V2 compounds.
     The ablauting verbs in Class III are ἀείρω, λέπω and μένω. Their morphology
explains the existence of V2 forms even in the absence of agentive simplicia, a
feature which we will also observe in a number of verbs derived from ablauting
roots included in Class IV. Preverbed forms of ἀείρω produce only one passive
V2 compound, τετράορος ‘four yoked together’, which reflects one of the mean-
ings of the verb: ‘take up and bring (together)’. The same SC is common in the
agentive formations derived from the compounded forms of the verb, for instance
μετήορος ‘lifted off the ground’ from μεταίρω ‘lift up’.
     μένω ‘stand’ creates a large number of agentive forms in -μονος, all of which,
however, are derivations of the preverbed verbs (e.g. παράμονος ‘steadfast’ from
παραμένω ‘stand fast’). There are no agent nouns corresponding to the simple
verb and no V2 compounds with a non-prepositional FC. A similar situation can
be observed in compounds derived from λέπω ‘leave’. In spite of the verb’s active
meaning, V2 compounds usually have intransitive or passive meanings and are
preverbed forms: see ἐπίλοιπος ‘remaining’, περ́λοιπος ‘surviving’, etc. These
correspond to the simplex λοιπός ‘remaining’, formally a type of agent noun,
which has acquired the semantics of an adjective.
     μένω, λείπω and ἀείρω all have productive V1 compounds. Those in μενε-,
μενο-, and μενεσι- are productive both as appellatives and as PNs, with a prefer-
ence for the latter. Compounds derived from λείπω are overwhelmingly appella-
tive: among the numerous poetic forms, it is worth noting the set of bureaucratic
terms λιποστρατίη ‘desertion from the army’ (Hdt.), λιποτελέω ‘to be in arrear
with taxes’ (Oeanthea, fifth c. BC), λειπογνώμων ‘lacking interpreters’ (Athens,
fourth c. BC), and λιποταξίa ‘desertion’ (Dem.). On the other hand, V1 compounds
in ἀερσι- appear to have been exclusively poetic: e.g. ἀερσίπους ‘lifting the feet,
high-stepping’ (Hom.), ἀερσίνοος (Causabon’s conjecture for the transmitted ἀερ-
σίπνοος in Ion Lyr. PMG 744) or ἀερσιπότης ‘lifting the flight, flying high’ (Hes.).

     The conclusion we ought to draw here is clear: the high number of V1 com-
pounds derived from these verbs is a result of the deficiency of their V2 counter-
parts, which have restricted verbal semantics. The V1 type is not in competition
with V2 compounds, but emerges to fill the gap left vacant by them.
7 Conclusion
This chapter has analysed the behaviour of V1 compounds in relation to other
formations from the same verbs, investigating the role fulfilled by these V1 com-
pounds where no V2 formations are attested. We have seen that the explanation
for the absence of these formations lies partly in the morphological constraints
of the verbs themselves, partly in the rarity of particular base verbs, and—in the
case of verbs creating agent nouns but no V2 compounds—in the semantic spe-
cialization of the simple agent nouns. In the case of Class III, an additional reason
is the fact that simple agent nouns tend to have intransitive semantics and only
allow prefixation.
     V1 compounds from Classes I and II provide a convenient alternative to the
missing V2 type. Not all of the families contain many items: we have attempted
to explain this low productivity by examining the semantics and use in context
of the base verbs. As concerns the productive families (four items or more), these
amount to eight for Class I and nineteen for Class II. Among them, there are a few
predominantly onomastic families (those derived from αἰνέω, ἀκέομαι, εὔχομαι,
ζεύγνυμι, κτάομαι, μέλω, ὀνίνημι, τίνω and perhaps πέπᾱμαι), but it would be
incorrect to claim that the V1 pattern is closely tied to onomastics: for exclusively
or mostly appellative families, see those derived from λανθάνω, δείδω, μείγνυμι,
τανύω (Class I) and αὔξω, ἐγείρω, ἐθέλω, ἔρυμαι/ἐρύω and κρύπτω (Class II).
     At the same time, the large number of new literary creations even in post-Clas-
sical and late-antique Greek shows that the V1 type enjoyed an enduring popu-
larity throughout the history of the language. As noted elsewhere in the present
study, we should therefore correct the current view that V1 compounds are on
the whole a scarcely productive relic. The great vitality of individual V1 families,
which testifies to the morphological productivity of the pattern, emerges even
more clearly from the study of Class IV carried out in the next chapter.

The Analysis of V1 Compounds Within the Greek
Compound System
Part II: V1 Compounds With a V2 Counterpart
1 Introduction        Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
This chapter studies V1 compounds derived from verbs that also give rise to
V2 agentive compounds (Class IV), with a particular focus on the interaction
between the two patterns. The complexity of this class calls for a variety of inves-
tigative approaches. The first part of the chapter analyses the morphology of the
verbs from which these V1/V2 pairs derive and brings to light the features which
distinguish these verbs from those in Classes I, II and III (Chapter 5). The focus
then turns to the agent nouns derived from these verbs, and in particular to the
interaction between agent nouns and V2 compounds, with the purpose of inves-
tigating how the semantics, formal characteristics and productivity of the former
affect the latter.
     The second part of the chapter is devoted to a full-scale study of the com-
pound families produced by each of the verbs in Class IV. The chronological
development, productivity and morphology of individual V1 compounds is com-
pared to that of their V2 counterparts in order to move closer to answering some of
the questions at the core of this book: do V1 and V2 compounds derived from the
same verb fulfil partly different functions? Is it true that V1 compounds are mostly
poetic, onomastic and recessive? Is the V2 pattern always the preferred one? Is
there a correlation between a given type of compound and particular linguistic
registers or stylistic contexts? In assessing these questions, we shall have to be
on the look out for morphological features and semantic constraints associated
with specific base verbs which may have influenced the choice of the V1 pattern.
     In order to gain an improved understanding of how V1 compounds interact
with right-oriented compounds, the third part of this chapter investigates the
relation between V1 compounds and active -́ς compounds (Class IVa), which
arguably took on the role of providing a means of creating a right-oriented type
in the absence of other agentive compounds (section 4). Finally, section 5 turns
to the small number of V1 compounds in competition with right-oriented types
that are structurally denominative rather than verbal, but from a semantic point
of view are in fact the equivalent of V2 compounds (Class IVb: type ἀναξίαλος :
ἀστυάναξ). The hope is that the combined study of these subclasses will provide
insights into the various kinds of interactions which affected Greek verbal com-
                                                                                                Olga Tribulato - 9783110415827

pounds as a whole. Finally, section 6 offers a few insights into the use of V1 com-
pounds in association with certain literary registers and briefly looks at the inter-
action between poetic language, phraseology and V1 compounds, highlighting
the issues which may have contributed to the choice of V1 compounds over other
verbal formations.
2 Class IV: the base verbs, their agent nouns
2 and verbal compounds                2 Class IV: the base verbs, their agent nouns and verbal compounds
Class IV contains verbs which produce agent nouns and use them to create V2
compounds that coexist with V1 compounds derived from the same verb. A more
limited subgroup, comprising verbs which only give rise to V2 compounds in -́ς
(Class IVa), will be introduced in section 2.3 and analysed in section 4.
      The verbs in Class IV are fifty-eight:
ἀγείρω ‘gather’, ἄγω ‘lead’, ἀκούω ‘listen’, ἀμείβω ‘change, exchange’, ἀραρίσκω
‘fit together’, ἁρπάζω ‘snatch away’, ἀρτύω ‘prepare’, ἄρχω ‘begin, lead’, βαίνω
‘step’, βλέπω ‘see’, βόσκω ‘feed’, γιγνώσκω ‘know’, δάκνω ‘bite’, δάμνημι/
δαμνάω/δαμάζω ‘tame’, δέχομαι ‘receive’, δίδωμι ‘give’, διώκω ‘chase, drive’,
ἐλάω ‘drive, set in motion, strike’, ἕλκω ‘drag’, ἔραμαι ‘love’, ἔρδω ‘do’, εὑρίσκω
‘discover’, ἔχω ‘have, hold’, ἡγέομαι ‘lead’, θέλγω ‘charm’, ἵστημι ‘stand’, καλέω
‘call’, κάμπτω ‘bend, turn’, κινέω ‘set in motion’, κλέπτω ‘steal’, κοσμέω ‘arrange,
equip’, κρούω ‘strike’, λαμβάνω ‘catch, receive’, λύω ‘release’, μιμνήσκω ‘remind
of, remember’, ὄλλυμι ‘destroy’, ὄρνυμι ‘incite, make to arise’, πέρθω ‘destroy’,
πήγνυμι ‘fix, make solid’, πλήσσω ‘strike’, πράσσω ‘accomplish, exact payment’,
ῥάπτω ‘sew together’, σείω ‘shake’, στέλλω ‘make ready, fit out, send’, στρέφω
‘turn, twist’, σώζω ‘save’, τελέω ‘fulfil, accomplish, kill’, τέμνω ‘cut’, τιμάω
‘honour’, τλῆναι ‘endure’, τρέφω ‘rear’, τρέχω ‘run’, φαγεῖν ‘eat’, φέρω ‘carry,
bring’, φεύγω ‘flee, shun’, φθείρω ‘destroy’, φράζω ‘indicate, tell’, φύω ‘produce’.
These verbs belong to the following classes:
– Athematic radical presents: ἔραμαι.
– Full-grade thematic radical presents: θέλγω, σείω1. ἄγω, a full-grade present,
      in Greek behaves like zero-grade radical presents in short vowel and pro-
      duces simple and compounded agent nouns in -ος.

      and σώζω form -ος V2 compounds (-ραφός and -σοός).11 The following -jé/ó-
      presents derive from CeC/CoC roots, and display the ablaut of those roots
2 The etymology of βλέπω is debated. The existence of root compounds in -βλωψ might imply
that it is based on an ablauting root; however, DEG acknowledges the possibility that this [o:]
may be analogical (perhaps on compounds in -ωψ), while EDG considers the possibility that the
verb is a ‘pre-Greek’ formation.
3 The [u:] displayed by the present of λύω in Classical Greek is analogical on the s-aorist: most
Homeric forms of λύω have [u] instead. The original root is reconstructed as *leu̯H- by LIV 417
(yielding the zero-grade thematic present stem *luH-é- in Greek) and as *leh1-u- by EDG.
4 φύω is a Greek innovation based on an original root aorist. The short vowel displayed by the
present is the result of a secondary opposition between [u:] and [u], and not a reflex of the orig-
inal zero-grade of the root, *bhuH-, since this yields [u:] in Greek. See EDG s.v. φύω and further
LIV 98–101.
5 The root of ἄρχω is obscure: perhaps *h2rgh- (EDG), pointing to an original zero grade. See fur-
ther LIV 498, which analyses ἄρχω as a *-sk é̑ /ó- zero-grade present from the root *regh-.
6 γιγνώσκω and μιμνήσκω derive from ablauting roots. The present is built on the zero grade,
but the laryngeals in the root yield a long vowel in Greek: *g̑n̥h3- > γνω-, *mn̥h2- > μνᾱ-. These
presents also display reduplication, which in -σκω verbs is a Greek innovation. Reduplication in
ἀραρίσκω derives from the stem of the thematic aorist ἤραρον, extended to the present: see LIV
269–270.
7 EDG posits a Greek form *akous-jō, possibly related to a root *h2kous-. Derivativations in ἀκο-
such as ἀκοή and compounds in -ηκοος display false ablaut, which is the result of shortening in
hiatus: see EDG s.v. ἀκούω.
8 EDG supposes that ἁρπάζω is a denominative, formed with the -jé/ó- suffix from a nominal
stem, ἁρπαγ-, and goes so far as to advance the hypothesis that, rather than being linked to an IE
root (*serp-?), the verb is a Proto-Greek formation. If so, the agent noun ἅρπαγος would represent
a form of greater antiquity than the verb instead of a derivation from it. See further section 3.2.
9 On this interpretation of κρούω, see LIV 371.
10 σώζω (older form σῴζω) probably derives from the contracted adjective σῶς (< σαός) ‘safe’
through the Greek suffix -ίζω, itself of denominative origin (from stems in -ιδ-): see DEG s.v. σῶς.
11 The root behind ῥάπτω is unclear: LIV 690 analyses it as a derivation from *u̯erp- ‘turn over
and over’, but admits that the semantics is problematic. LIV fails to acknowledge, however, that

–    -jé/ó- or -éje/o- presents which yield vocalic verbs in Greek: ἀρτύω,12 ἐλάω,13

–    Athematic radical aorists: τλῆναι.
–    Zero-grade thematic aorists: φαγεῖν.
–    Verbs of unclear etymology or formation: διώκω.14
The verbs in Class IV belong to the full range of Greek verbal formations. Among
them, those derived from ablauting roots are particularly numerous and distrib-
uted across several classes: e-grade thematic presents of the CeC/CoC type (ἀμείβω,
δέχομαι, ἕλκω, ἔρδω, ἔχω, πέρθω, στρέφω, τέμνω, τρέφω, τρέχω, φέρω), -jé/ó-
presents derived from CeC/CoC roots (ἀγείρω, κλέπτω, στέλλω, φθείρω), e-grade
presents alternating with zero-grade formations (φεύγω), and athematic redu-
plicated presents (δίδωμι, ἵστημι), amounting to eighteen verbs overall. Fifteen
of the verbs in the first three groups give rise to -ος agent nouns, as do presents
with a short vowel (ἄγω, ἄρχω), the nasal presents δάκνω, δάμνημι/δαμάζω and
λαμβάνω, the -jé/ó- presents ῥάπτω and σώζω, and the zero-grade aorist φαγεῖν:
in summary, twenty-three of the fifty-eight verbs in Class IV produce an -ος agent
noun of some kind, a fact which distinguishes this class from Classes I and II.
2.1 Verbs in Class IV and their agent nouns
In order to gain a thorough understanding of the make-up of agent nouns derived
from the verbs in Class IV, we need first to consider several facts pertaining to the
interaction between the original roots and the present formations. Greek recon-
figured many old roots into new patterns, often moving away from the original
present (or aorist) formation. The original formation can, however, offer a valu-
able insight into the behaviour of certain Greek verbs with respect to ablaut and
derivation, particularly so far as the creation and morphology of agent nouns is
concerned.
the Mycenaean plural participle e-ra-pe-me-na /erraphmena/ ‘stitched’ shows that the verb had
no initial [w] in Greek: see further EDG s.v. ῥάπτω.
12 According to EDG, ἀρτύω is a denominative from ἀρτύς ‘ordering’, a word attested only in
Hesychius, which would derive from the root *h2er-.
13 ἐλαύνω seems to be a younger form than ἐλάω, but its origin is not clear: see GEW, EDG s.v.

              2 Class IV: the base verbs, their agent nouns and verbal compounds               261
     It may be beneficial at this point to consider two examples. Given its morpho-
logical make-up, we would expect the Greek -jé/ó- present κλέπτω to create the
agent noun κλεπ-της, just as πράσσω (< πρακ-jé/ó-) creates πρήκτης and πρακτήρ.
This expectation would be well founded, since Greek does indeed contain the
agent nouns κλέπτης (Hom.) and κλεπτήρ (Man.). At the same time, however,
the existence of the rare agent noun κλοπός ‘thief’ and, more importantly, the
existence of V2 compounds in -κλοπος such as ἀνδραποδοκλόπος ‘slave-stealer’
(Soph.) reveal that κλέπτω derives from a CeC/CoC root, whose ablaut surfaces
in the perfect κέκλοφα and in the iterative ὑποκλοπέομαι ‘lurk in secret places’.
κλέπτω has therefore replaced the radical present **κλέπω, which finds a par-
allel in the Latin clepō. This morphological reshaping of the Greek present from
the root *klep- in turn has an effect on the structure of the agent nouns and com-
pounds derived from it: the old (and morphologically inherited) forms displaying
the o-grade κλοπ- are eventually replaced by those in κλεπ-, as if κλέπτω did not
derive from an ablauting root (see the analysis in section 3.1). A similar chain of
morphological readjustments applies in the case of the new -jé/ó- present ῥάπτω:
in late-antique Greek this creates the agent noun ῥάπτης ‘mender’, but the orig-
inal agent noun ought to have been **ῥαφός, as the V2 compounds in -(ρ)ραφος
demonstrate.
     The second example concerns Greek verbs which have largely forsaken the
original ablaut of the IE root and whose derivations mostly reflect the vocalism
of the present stem. This phenomenon can be illustrated by means of two verbs,
both of which belong to the same category of presents formed with a nasal infix:
δάμνημι/δαμνάω and δάκνω (the fact that the former alternates between the ath-
ematic δάμνημι and the thematic δαμνάω is of no relevance here). These presents
are built on the zero grade of the ablauting roots *demh2- and *denk ̑- and, in
chronological terms, are secondary formations: in both cases, the primary for-
mation from these roots was the root aorist, which in Greek was then replaced
by the sigmatic aorist ἐδάμασσα and the thematic aorist ἔδακον respectively.15
Although these roots do have an o-grade, reflected in the Latin verb domō and
in the late Vedic causative present dam̐śayati ‘to cause to bite’ (< *donk ̑-),16
Greek has extended the zero grade to the whole paradigm. As with other Greek
presents characterized by a short vowel, the result is that the V2 compounds
derived from δάμνημι and δάκνω display [a]: see the V2 compounds in -δᾰμος
(e.g. ἱππόδαμος ‘taming horses’) and -δᾰκής (e.g. θυμοδακής ‘biting the heart’).
However, both verbs also have agent nouns characterized by a long vowel: in the
15 See LIV 116 and 117.
16 See LIV s.v. *denk -̑ . [a] is the regular reflex of IE [o] in Sanskrit. m̐ represents the ‘true
Anusvāra’, transcribed with n in Monier-Williams.

262          Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
case of δάμνημι/δαμνάω, the agent noun δμητήρ ‘tamer’ (Hom.) is the result of
the analogical extension of the zero grade *dm̥h2-; in the case of δάκνω, the agent
noun δήκτης ‘biter’ (< δᾱκτης) has an analogical [a:], which cannot represent the
original development of the e-grade *denk ̑-.
     The examples of κλέπτω on the one hand and δάμνημι/δαμνάω and δάκνω on
the other bear out the well-known Greek tendency to alter inherited ablaut pat-
terns in the interests of morphological regularity. These examples also serve as a
useful means of linking the above list of Greek presents, in which the verbs are
classified according to a combination of historical morphology and synchronic
description, with the lists of agent nouns laid out below. These lists classify agent
nouns solely according to their morphology, i.e. irrespective of the shape of the
presents to which they are related: in each list, the verbs precede the agent nouns
in order both to facilitate alphabetization and to throw into relief the fact that the
same kind of agent noun may be linked to very different present formations.
2.1.1 Agent nouns and active V2 compounds of the CoC-os type
– ἀγείρω > compounds in -ηγόρος, e.g. ri-na-ko-ro ‘linen-gatherer’. In later
     Greek, V2 compounds in -ηγόρος have come to be associated with ἀγορεύω
     ‘speak’: the productive V2 compounds derived from ἀγείρω are those in
     -ηγερέτης (see section 3.2).
– ἀμείβω > ἀμοιβός ‘one who exchanges’ and compounds in -αμοιβός (Aesch.).
– δέχομαι > compounds in -δόκος and -δόχος (Hom.).17
– ἕλκω > ὁλκός ‘hauling-engine’ (Hdt.) and V2 compounds in -ουλκός (Aesch.).
– ἔρδω > compounds in -ουργός and -εργός (Myc.).
– ἔχω > compounds in -οχος (Myc.).
– κλέπτω > κλοπός ‘thief’ (Hom.) and compounds in -κλόπος (Soph.).
– πέρθω > only the V2 compound πτολιπόρθος ‘destroying cities’ (Hom.).
– στέλλω > some V2 compounds in -στολος, e.g. πυγοστόλος ‘decorating her
     buttocks’ (Hes.).
– στρέφω > compounds in -στρόφος (Pi.).
– τέμνω > τομός ‘cutting’ (an agent noun which has acquired an adjectival
     function) and compounds in -τομός (Hom.).
– τρέφω > τροφός ‘nurse’ (Hom.) and compounds in -τρόφος (Hom.).
– τρέχω > τροχός ‘wheel’ (Hom.) and the V2 compound ἁλίτροχος ‘running
     through the sea’ (Ibyc.).
– φέρω > compounds in -φόρος (Hom.).
– φθείρω > compounds in -φθόρος (Thgn.).

               2 Class IV: the base verbs, their agent nouns and verbal compounds         263
The fifteen base verbs in this list tend to create only agent nouns and V2 com-
pounds in -ος: δέχομαι and κλέπτω are the only verbs which produce -της agent
nouns side by side with the original CoC-os ones; these -της forms also become
more common over time (the need for paradigmatic regularity is behind this in
the case of κλέπτω). Another clearly discernible tendency in this group is for V2
compounds to exist even in the absence of simple agent nouns, while this is not
the case for the group of compounds in -της analysed in 2.1.3 below. We will see
in the analysis of individual compound families that CoC-os forms usually create
very productive compound categories (see those derived from δέχομαι, ἔρδω, ἔχω,
πέρθω, στρέφω, φέρω, φθείρω). This happens regardless of whether a simplex is
attested: the V2 compounds derived from ἔρδω and ἔχω, for instance, are among
the most common V2 compounds throughout the history of the language, despite
the absence of any corresponding simplicia.18
2.1.2 Agent nouns and active -ος V2 compounds in short vowel
– ἄγω > ἀγός ‘leader’ and compounds in -ᾱγός/-ηγός (Hom.).
– ἄρχω > ἀρχός ‘leader’ and compounds in -αρχος (Myc.).
– δάμνημι/δαμάζω > compounds in -δαμος (Hom.).
– πήγνυμι > compounds in -πηγός (Hom.).19
– ῥάπτω > compounds in -ρράφος (Soph.).
– σώζω > compounds in -σόος (A.R.).
– φαγεῖν > φάγος ‘glutton’ (NT) and compounds in -φαγος (Hom.).
– φεύγω > only the V2 compound ὀψίφυγος ‘fleeing late’ (Hdn.).
This group is smaller because the verbal roots involved are more restricted in
number. The ratio of V2 compounds accompanied by an agent noun to those
lacking a corresponding simplex is similar to that observed in the previous group:
again there is a tendency for compounds to be created even in the absence of a
simple agent noun (see those derived from πήγνυμι, ῥάπτω, σώζω and φεύγω).
     So far as -ος forms in short vowel in particular are concerned, however, an
interesting phenomenon becomes evident when they are grouped together: the
majority of the agent nouns and V2 compounds in our list are accompanied by
simplicia in -της, -τήρ and -τωρ. In fact this applies to all of the verbs except
πήγνυμι, φαγεῖν and φεύγω. In the case of the last two, the extreme popularity
of compounds in -φαγος may have rendered the creation of a different type of
18 Chapter 2, section 6.3.2.
19 Greek has extended the long vowel of the e-grade to agentive compounds (we would expect
-πᾰγός as in compounds in -πᾰγής).

agentive V2 compound redundant, while φεύγω is in any case not a particularly
productive source of agent nouns and V2 compounds, to the point that verbal
compounds derived from φεύγω are of the V1 type.
     As for the verbs which do develop alternative forms, ἄγω, ἄρχω, δάμνημι/
δαμάζω and σώζω develop simplicia (ἄκτωρ, ἀρχέτᾱς, δμητήρ and σωτήρ respec-
tively) which are not accompanied by compounded counterparts in -της: the pro-
ductive V2 compounds continue to be those in -ηγός, -αρχος, -δαμος (though this
type is restricted) and -σόος. The agent noun δαμαστής derived from δαμάζω is a
hapax. ῥάπτω is the only verb whose agent noun, ῥάπτης, is also compounded.
     Some of these alternating agent nouns survive in MG while others have dis-
appeared. Compounds in -αρχος and -ηγός have continued to be productive, but
the primary agent nouns ἀγός and ἀρχός are no longer in use; the secondary
nouns ἀρχέτᾱς and ἄκτωρ, both rare forms already in the ancient language, have
become extinct. Compounds in -δαμος have died out in MG and been replaced by
those in -δαμαστής (from δαμάζω), which correspond to the simple agent noun
δαμαστής ‘tamer’. Compounds in -σόος have been replaced by more transparent
ones in -σωος, since σώζω is still used in MG; σωτήρ survives as σωτήρας, which
produces four compounds (λαοσωτήρας, εθνοσωτήρας, ανθρωποσωτήρας,
πισσωτήρας).20
2.1.3 Agent nouns in -τηρ and -τωρ
– ἄγω > ἄκτωρ ‘leader’ (Aesch.).
– ἀρτύω > ἀρτυτήρ ‘director’ (Thera, third c. BC) and the V2 compound
     ὀψαρτῡτής ‘cook’ (Hyp.).
– βαίνω > βατήρ (Amips.) ‘that on which one treads, threshold’.
– βόσκω > βοτήρ and βώτωρ, both ‘herdsman’ (Hom.), and the V2 compound
     μηλοβοτήρ ‘herdsman’ (Hom.).
– γιγνώσκω > γνωστήρ ‘one that knows; surety’ (Xen.).

    V2 compound πολυμνήστωρ ‘much-remembering’ (Aesch.).

    (Aesch.), -ολέτωρ (Aesch.), and -ολέτης (Phil. Epigr.).
–   πλήσσω > πληκτήρ ‘striking object or person’ (Hdn.),21 πλάκτωρ (Doric form,
    Phanias Epigr.).
–   πράσσω > πρηκτήρ ‘doer’ (Hom.), πράκτωρ ‘one who does or executes’
    (Soph.) and the V2 compound λογοπράκτωρ (dubious sense, PBaden 26.40,
    third c. AD).

–   φύω > φύτωρ ‘begetter’ (Hsch.) and two compounds in -φύτωρ (Pl.).
Agent nouns in -τήρ and -τωρ are numerous but, overall, recessive. The Greek
rule prohibiting the compounding of agent nouns in -τήρ and -τωρ (Chapter 2,
section 6.4) is often breached: see μηλοβοτήρ ‘herdsman’ (which, however, is only
used by Homer and his late imitators), πανθέλκτειρα, two compounds in -κλητήρ,
two compounds in -κλήτωρ, πολυμνήστωρ, a few forms in -ολέτωρ/-ολέτειρα,
λογοπράκτωρ and two compounds in -φύτωρ. It may be noted that in all these
cases, ἀρτύω, βαίνω and βόσκω aside, parallel compounds in -της are either
lacking or of limited productivity: compounds in -ολέτης start with θηρολέτης in
the epigrammatist Philippus (first c. AD) and eventually come to five forms, while
compounds in -πράκτης are limited to the hapax παντοπράκτης ‘ready to do any-
thing’, attested in the second-century AD mathematician Ptolemaeus.

     The forms in this list confirm that the tendency is for simplicia in -τηρ and
-τωρ to be progressively replaced by forms in -της: of the twenty-eight verbs in
this list, only ἔρδω, καλέω, μιμνήσκω, ὄρνυμι and φύω never give rise to a -της
simplex. It will not come as a surprise, therefore, that the group of -της agent
nouns and V2 compounds corresponding to V1 compounds, collected in 2.1.4, is
the most numerous of the four.
2.1.4 Agent nouns and V2 compounds in -της
– ἀγείρω > ἀγέρτᾱς ‘collector of dues’ (Tauromenium, Hellenistic age),
     σιταγέρτης ‘collector of corn’ (Heraclea, fourth c. BC), and compounds in
     -ηγερέτης (Hom.).
– ἄγω (or ἡγέομαι?) > compounds in -ηγέτης (Myc.).
– ἀκούω > ἀκουστής ’hearer’ (Men.) and the V2 compound ὠτακουστής ‘eaves-
     dropper’ (Aristot.).
– ἀραρίσκω > only the V2 compound πυλάρτης ‘gate-fastener’ (Hom.).
– ἄρχω > ἀρχέτᾱς ‘leader’ (Eur.).
– βαίνω > βάτης ‘one that treads’ (Philox.) and compounds in -βάτης (Pi.). The
     V2 compound ἐμπυριβήτης ‘standing in the fire’ contains a different agent
     noun, based on the full grade of the root.
– γιγνώσκω > γνώστης ‘one that knows’ (NT) and the V2 compound
     καρδιογνώστης ‘knower of hearts’ (NT).
– δάκνω > δήκτης ‘biter’ (Eur.) and λαθροδήκτης ‘biting secretly’ (Phryn.).
– δέχομαι > δέκτης ‘receiver, beggar’ (Hom.) and compounds in -δέκτης (H.
     Hom. Cer.).
– δαμάζω > δαμαστής ‘tamer’ (Ps. Epich.? For this hapax, see the analysis of
     δαμάζω in section 3.1) and two compounds in -δαμαστής (PMich.Zen. 71.4,
     third c. BC).
– δίδωμι > δώτης (Hes.), δότης (LXX) ‘giver’ and compounds in -δώτης (Hes.)
     and -δότης (Hes.).

    AD) and the compound πυργοσείστης ‘tower-shaker’ (Anon. in Rhetorica

    σκινδαλαμοφράστης ‘straw-splitter’ (Agath.).
The majority of verbs in this group have both simplicia and V2 compounds in -της.
The only verbs which give rise to compounds but lack a simplex in -της are ἄγω,
ἀραρίσκω, ἵστημι, κάμπτω, λύω, ὄλλυμι and ὄρνυμι: apart from ἀραρίσκω and
ὄρνυμι, the other three verbs have alternative agent nouns, as we have already
seen in section 2.1.3.
    The V2 compounds which have their origin in the Classical and early Hel-
lenistic ages form the majority, while the compounds attested after this period
are those derived from δάκνω, εὑρίσκω, κινέω, κρούω, λύω, ὄλλυμι, πλήσσω,
ῥάπτω, τελέω, τιμάω and φράζω. The detailed comparison of V1 and V2 com-
pounds which follows in this chapter will show that the late or low productivity
of many of these V2 families is linked to the higher productivity of correspond-

V1 compounds in κρουσι-), λύω (whose V1 compounds are extremely common),

V1 compounds).

– ἁρπάζω > of the agent nouns produced by this verb (ἁρπακτήρ, Hom.; ἅρπαξ,
     Aristoph.; ἁρπακτής, Call., all meaning ‘robber’; and ἅρπαγος ‘hook’, Aesch.),
     only the root noun ἅρπαξ is used in a V2 compound: δελεάρπαξ ‘snapping at
     the bait’ (Leon.), a hapax.
– βλέπω > the root compound κυνοβλώψ (Hsch.), whose SC is already attested
     in the Homeric παραβλώψ ‘looking askance’; the late compounded participle
     πολυβλέπων (P. Lond. 5.1821.268).
– βόσκω > the agent noun βοσκός ‘herdsman’ and the V2 compounds in -βοσκός
     are secondarily derived from the present following the pattern of agent nouns
     in -ος (see Chapter 4, section 8.4).
– δάμνημι/δαμάζω > compounds in -δάμας ‘taming’.
– κλέπτω > the root compound βοόκλεψ ‘stealing oxen’ (Soph.) and the root
     agent noun κλέψ ‘thief’ (Phryn.: a back-formation from βοόκλεψ?); the root
     agent noun κλώψ ‘thief’ (Hdt.).
– μιμνήσκω > μνήμων ‘mindful’ (Hom.) and its compound ἀμνήμων ‘unmind-
     ful’ (Pi.).
– τλῆναι > rare compounds in -τλήμων and -τλας ‘bearing’ (Hom.).
All things considered, these are recessive types, although different kinds of phe-
nomena affect each individual form. κλώψ, κλέψ and its compound are soon
replaced by κλέπτης and κλοπός with their compounds. κυνοβλώψ is a hapax.
     βοσκός is a curious innovation, not just because it keeps the -σκ- suffix
of the present stem but also because the existence of the agent nouns βοτήρ
and βώτωρ, which have productive compounded forms in -βώτης and -βότης,
renders it semantically redundant. It could be that this innovation was originally
prompted by the desire to separate the idea of ‘feeding, nourishing’ from the
notion of ‘herdsman’, which βοτήρ, βώτωρ and their compounds had acquired,
in part through their phonological similarity to βοῦς ‘cow’. However, compounds
in -βοσκός express the notions both of ‘feeder’ and of ‘herdsman’, just as com-
pounds in -βώτης and -βότης do, with the result that, even if this semantic dif-
ferentiation was present at an earlier time, it is no longer visible in our sources.

             2 Class IV: the base verbs, their agent nouns and verbal compounds         269
     What we are faced with in the other cases are various alternative means of
forming nouns or compounds with agentive semantics. The suffixes -μων (*-mōn)
and -ᾱς (< -α-ντς) are linked to verbal stems: the latter contains the participial
suffix -ντ- and its -α- in fact derives from the [a] (usually *h2) of disyllabic roots
(as is the case with δάμνημι and τλῆναι here), but synchronically these forms
are not participles. The nouns formed with these two suffixes express active
semantics and can also be used with an adjectival function (as is the case with
μνήμων ‘mindful’). While forms in -τλας are limited, and always display an adjec-
tival-adverbial FC, those in -δαμας and -μνήμων are more productive and can
also be compounded with substantival FCs: e.g. ἀνδροδάμας ‘man-taming’ and
ἱερομνήμων ‘mindful of sacred things’. The sole case of a compounded participle,
πολυβλέπων, is a late form which is not productive elsewhere.
     The agent nouns and compounds in this group offer a valuable glimpse of
the kinds of phenomena that we will be discussing in relation to the competition
between V1/V2 pairs. The language exploits various morphological patterns for
the purpose of creating formally convenient and semantically transparent agent
nouns, many of which have compounded counterparts. When the morphology
of a given verb hinders the application of the more established patterns, Greek
resorts to alternative means: we have just examined the case of root nouns and
forms in -μων and -ας, and the creation of a secondary -ος noun from the present
stem (βοσκός). To these strategies, we must add the creation of V1 compounds
and the creation of compounds in -ής, a phenomenon associated with other com-
pound families analysed in this chapter.
2.2 Relevance of morphological analysis to the investigation of V1/V2 pairs
Certain patterns have now begun to come into view in the uncharted and seem-
ingly haphazard expanse of parallel V1/V2 compounds. In the first place, verbs
producing agentive formations in -ος (collected in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2) develop
extremely productive compound families. In some cases, these V2 compounds
are accompanied by forms in -της (see e.g. ἄγω or δέχομαι), but these newer forms
never replace compounds in -ος. Given this productiveness, we can predict that
in most cases the alternative V1 compounds will not become genuine rivals to
these V2 forms. The existence of V1 compounds may therefore be influenced by
other factors. We will investigate two potential causes in the following analysis:
onomastics and stylistic variation in literary language.
     In the case of verbs which give rise to -τηρ and -τωρ simplicia (section 2.1.3),
the situation is rather different. These are subject to a morphological rule which,
by and large, makes them unsuitable for compounding and prescribes that they

270          Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
are replaced by compound forms in -της. We can anticipate, therefore, that in
such cases the competition between V1 and V2 forms will be stronger because V1
compounds provide an already established model.
     The forms collected in 2.1.4 allow us to see at a glance the relation between V1
compounds and those in -της. And what we find is that, while agentive forms in
-της are pervasive, in a large number of cases they are first attested in post-Clas-
sical Greek (see those derived from ἀγείρω, ἀκούω, γιγνώσκω, δάκνω, δαμάζω,
διώκω, εὑρίσκω, κινέω, κοσμέω, κρούω, λαμβάνω, λύω, ὄλλυμι, πλήσσω,
πράσσω, ῥάπτω, σείω, τελέω, τιμάω, φράζω) or, although documented earlier,
are infrequently attested (see ἀραρίσκω, ὄρνυμι), leaving only those derived from
ἄγω, ἄρχω, δέχομαι, ἐλάω, ἔραμαι, ἡγέομαι, κάμπτω and κλέπτω as seemingly
productive types. Given the rarity of the -της compounds derived from many
verbs, it is necessary to investigate how the language fulfils the need for an agen-
tive compound derived from these bases, to what extent the V1 pattern is predom-
inant, and whether alternative means of creating V2 compounds are exploited.
The analysis of -́ς compounds in section 4 reveals that δάκνω, λαμβάνω, ὄλλυμι,
πλήσσω, ῥάπτω, τελέω, τιμάω and φράζω produce alternative right-oriented
compounds, but that the other verbs do not: in the conclusion we shall note that
a number of the V1 compounds corresponding to less productive -της forms are
very common.
2.3 Verbs with only active V2 compounds in -ής
A small group of verbs do not produce agent nouns or agentive compounds in
-ος/-της, but develop verbal adjectives in -ής endowed with active semantics. This
phenomenon must be viewed in light of the long-term evolution of verbal adjec-
tives in -ής, which seem to have originated from intransitive or passive verbs in
the first instance: the creation of entire classes of active compounds is in general
a limited phenomenon and it is worth considering in which cases it may be linked
to the need to create pairs of V1 and V2 compounds.
     The verbs involved in this development, which are fully analysed in section 4,
are seventeen:
ἀλγέω ‘grieve’, ἀλφάνω ‘bring in’, ἀρκέω ‘keep off, avail, be sufficient’, βλάπτω
‘distract, pervert, damage’, δέρκομαι ‘see’, θάλλω/θαλέω ‘sprout, blossom’,
μαίνομαι ‘rage, be mad’, μισέω ‘hate’, πείθω ‘persuade’/πείθομαι ‘obey’, στέργω
‘love’, τέρπω ‘delight’, τήκω ‘consume’, φαίνω ‘show, make to appear, reveal’, φάω
‘shine’, φείδομαι ‘spare’, φλέγω ‘burn’, χαίρω ‘rejoice, take pleasure in’.

Besides these more clear-cut families (Class IV), Greek also develops a number of
active -ής compounds side by side with other V2 compounds. An example is the
group of compounds in -δακής ‘biting’, a typical case of morphological replace-
ment: while, in general, active -ής compounds arise through a semantic reanal-
ysis of passive -ής compounds, those in -δακής are all active from the start. They
seem to have been created to compensate for the unproductive character of the
more traditional agentive formations: the agent noun δήκτης ‘biter’ and its only
compound λαθροδήκτης ‘biting secretly’ (section 2.1.4) are rare forms. These
alternative -ής forms will be included in the analysis of V1 and V2 compounds
from Class IV below (sections 3.1 and 3.2), while section 4 will situate their devel-
opment within the evolution of the whole class of deverbal -ής compounds.
3 Competing pairs of V1 and V2 compounds:
3 a contrastive analysis          3 Competing pairs of V1 and V2 compounds: a contrastive analysis
The purpose of this part of the chapter is to compare the use and productivity of
V1 and agentive V2 compounds derived from the verbs of Class IV, so as to gain
a more comprehensive understanding of their interaction. In Chapter 5 we tested
the hypothesis that the existence of a good number of V1 compounds is due to the
deficiencies associated with the relevant V2 compounds. A natural consequence
of this hypothesis is that V1 compounds should not be attested when V2 com-
pounds derived from the same verb exist, or at least that the V1 pattern should not
productive. A close investigation of all V1/V2 pairs in part confirms that V2 com-
pounds are indeed generally more productive: in these families, V1 compounds
tend to be onomastic, or more productive in onomastics than in the appellative
domain.
     There are also families, however, in which the V1 pattern is favoured or where
we find it highly developed also in the appellative lexicon. The reason for this
state of affairs varies from verb to verb, but in general terms the make-up, chro-
nology and productivity of the agent nouns and compounds created by each indi-
vidual verb play no small part in determining the creation and continuing pro-
ductivity of certain V1 compounds (a hypothesis already anticipated in section
2.2). For instance, we will see that V1 forms derived from λύω are very common,
and this seems to be connected with the fact that the verb produces only a few
late and extremely rare compounds in -λύτης and does not develop alternative
types of right-oriented compounds.
     The verbs of Class IV are divided into two subgroups. The first contains sev-
enteen compound families in which V1 and V2 compounds are both numerous
and productive. As we will see in the conclusion to this part of the chapter, many
                                                                                                   Olga Tribulato - 9783110415827

of these families have V2 compounds in -ος. The second subgroup consists of
forty-one compound families in which either one of the two patterns is unproduc-
tive or the productivity of both types of compounds is low. V2 compounds in this
subgroup are of various kinds, and the reason for the low attestation of a given
form may be semantic or morphological in nature, or may indeed be obscure. This
second subgroup mostly contains V2 compounds in -της and many of these have
low productivity: those in -ος, by contrast, tend to be prolific when attested.
3.1 Productive compound families
ἄγω
The compound family derived from this verb provides an excellent introduction
to the phenomena which persistently characterize the interaction of V1 and V2
compounds. V2 compounds in -ᾱγός/-ηγός are by far the more productive, con-
tinuing into Byzantine and Modern Greek (for this reason, the cut-off point for
the collection of V2 compounds in the Corpus is the end of the fourth century BC).
They often provide occupational terms (e.g. στρατηγός ‘army leader’, κυνᾱγός
‘huntsman’, λοχᾱγός ‘leader of an armed band’, χορηγός ‘chorus-leader’, etc.), as
well as a number of adjectives (e.g. ἀρχηγός ‘originating’ and χοληγός ‘carrying
off bile’). The V2 compounds indicate a more specific entity than their V1 coun-
teparts: for instance, the λοχᾱγός is the leader of an armed band and not simply
someone who leads or may lead a band.
      The distribution of the V1 forms, on the other hand, is a telling one. Appel-
latives amount to four very old forms, two of which—ἀγήνωρ [lead men] ‘heroic’
and ἀγέστρατος ‘host-leading’—are specialized as epithets.22 This type is there-
fore on the wane already within the Archaic age and individual forms survive
because of their ornamental character and epic flavour. In onomastics, on the
22 The third compound, ἀγέχορος, is G. Hermann’s plausible conjecture for the sequence ἄγε
χορόν transmitted by cod. R at Aristoph. Lys. 1281 Wilson (ἄγετε χορόν recentiores), in the con-
text of the so-called ‘Attic song’. Many editors, including Henderson (1987) and Wilson (2007),
print the Doric hapax ᾱ̔γέχορον from ἡγέομαι, on account of metre (since the line is interpreted
as a catalectic trochaic trimeter). This, however, introduces an exceptional Doric feature in a
song which is otherwise transmitted as being in Attic-Ionic (see e.g. the relative ἥν of l. 1290). To
explain this oddity, Henderson (1987: 217) comments that ‘perhaps the ambassador wants to give
the invocation some Doric colouring’: against this reasoning, see Colvin (1999: 262). Parker (1997:
391) also advises against accepting the emendation ‘without reserve’. On balance, the interpreta-
tion of the form as the compound ἀγέχορος (from ἄγω), as in Coulon’s edition, is the best one: it
eliminates the linguistic problem and at the same time allows for greater stylistic variation than
the transmitted ἄγε χορόν, which would be a repetition of the imperatives πρόσαγε and ἔπαγε of
the preceding line.

other hand, we find seventeen different compounds in -αγός/-ηγός, a fact which
suggests that in this case the V1 type mostly survived because it was felt to be
suitable for the needs of onomastics. From this perspective, the fact that three
out of the four appellative compounds are epithets acquires a new significance:
their use as such could be seen to represent a borrowing from the practice of
name-giving. Conversely, V2 compounds in -ηγός are not often attested in ono-
mastics, and when they are, it is usually the case that the compound is also
used in the appellative lexicon to indicate a profession. Thus, the PN Κυνηγός
should be understood as ‘Mr Hunter’ rather than as ‘one who leads the hounds’;
Στρατηγός is ‘Mr Colonel’ rather than ‘one who leads an army’, etc. There are only
three pairs formed from the same constituents:  ̓Αγέλοχος and λοχᾱγός,  ̓Αγέαρχος
and ἀρχηγός,  ̓Αγέσιππος and ἱππηγός (the latter, not included in the Corpus, is
attested in Philochorus and qualifies ships equipped for the transportation of
horses).
ἄρχω
This compound family is one of the most productive in Greek and is likely to have
been present already in Mycenaean, where PNs such as a-ke-ra-wo or a-ke-wa-ta
can be interpreted as containing the FC ἀρχε-, while the appellative ka-ra-na-ko
may refer to the ‘supervisor of water supply’ (/krānarkhos/ < κρήνη ‘fountain’). V1
PNs are widespread, but appellative forms are more common still. This is princi-
pally due to the fact that the first constituent ἀρχι- was soon grammaticalized as
a prefix meaning ‘chief’ and was often attached to words indicating jobs or occu-
pations, providing a convenient means for the creation of a sort of professional
hierarchy. This process was in origin a semantic one, as already mentioned in
Chapter 4, section 3.2. A compound like ἀρχιδικαστής, indicating a person who
leads or coordinates the judges in a court, basically identifies the chief judge:
ἀρχι- no longer has a verbal function, becoming instead a form of tag.23
     This rapid specialization of V1 compounds derived from ἄρχω is the likely
cause of the disappearance, already by the end of the fifth century BC, of forms
in which the FC has a genuine governing function: if we can trust our sources,
no new formations are created after this point, a fact that has important conse-
quences for the productivity of V2 specimina. Once we recognize that compounds
in ἀρχι- represent a class apart, it becomes clear that there is little scope for com-
petition between the V1 and V2 patterns. V2 compounds are the productive type,
and the partial list provided in the Corpus, which takes the end of the fourth c. BC
as its cut off point, affords a glimpse of the pervasiveness of this type in every reg-
23 For other similar cases of grammaticalization, see Chapter 5, section 4.4 (compounds in μιξο-,
φθινο- and τανυ-) and section 5.3.1 (compounds in ἐθελο-, κρυψι- and μελλο-).

ister and through all periods of the Greek language. This is further confirmed by
the very low rate of semantic overlap between V1 and V2 compounds derived from
this verb. Two (out of three) appellative V1 compounds in the Corpus (i.e. exclud-
ing those which have acquired a determinative structure) have V2 counterparts:
see ἀρχέπολις ‘ruling a city’ (Pi.) and πολίαρχος ‘ruler of a city (Pi.), ἀρχεσίμολπος
‘beginning the song’ (Stes.) and μολπαρχέω, ‘lead the song and dance’ (IG
12(7).415), which presupposes **μόλπαρχος). On the other hand, V1 PNs evoke
images that are not found in connection with the V2 pattern: see for instance
 ̓Αρχίλοχος,  ̓Αρχαγόρᾱς,  ̓́Αρχανδρος,  ̓Αρχεαγάθᾱ,  ̓Αρχεάναξ,  ̓Αρχέδειπνος and
 ̓Αρχένοος (the list is not exhaustive).
     Yet despite the productive and unproblematic nature of compounds in -αρχος,
from early on Greek developed an alternative type in -ης (< -ᾱς), to the point that
in our extant sources many -άρχης forms appear to be exactly contemporary with
those in -αρχος: an example is νομάρχης ‘governor of a region’, attested in Hero-
dotus alongside νόμαρχος. The linguistic process which gives rise to these new
formations involves the creation of denominatives from compounds in -αρχος
(such as νομαρχέω ‘to hold the office of governor of a region’ from νόμαρχος):
such denominatives are extremely common already in Classical Greek. These
verbs in turn produce compounds in -άρχης, and this becomes such a common
pattern that we find new forms being created even in the absence of a base verb.
In the case of ἄρχω, this morphological process is also supported by the existence
of the feminine noun ἀρχή, according to the system of triplets involving a noun
in [a:] (> Attic-Ionic η), a compound in -ᾱς/-ης, and a denominative verb in -έω or
-άω investigated by Rüedi (1969), e.g. νίκη ‘victory’,  ̓Ολυμπιονίκᾱς ‘winner of an
Olympiad’ and νικάω ‘to win’.24
     There is no obvious reason why both the type in -αρχος and that in -άρχης
continued to be preserved, and this gives us a good idea of the great morpho-
logical flexibility of the Greek compound system. Eventually, the latter won
out as the sole productive type: it is common in Standard Modern Greek, with
old words such as πατριάρχης ‘head of the orthodox church’ or γυμνασιάρχης
‘headmaster of high school’ side by side with new forms, ranging from learned
terms such as εργοστασιάρχης ‘factory owner’ to recent non-learned examples
such as κονεξιάρχης ‘somebody who advances through good connections’ and
καναλάρχης ‘TV channel owner’, in both of which the FCs derive from the English
words connection and channel (the former has infiltrated slang with the plural
form τα κονέξια ‘connections’, while the latter has further extended the seman-

tics of the Latin loanword κανάλι ‘canal’).25 The few common MG compounds in
-αρχος, on the other hand, all tend to be resurrections from AG.
δάμνημι/δαμάζω
Compounds derived from these two verbs are relatively productive until the end
of the Classical age. New forms are created both as V1 compounds in δαμνα/ε- or
δαμασι- and as V2 compounds in -δαμος or -δαμαστής. After the Classical age,
new V1 and V2 forms are limited to δάμνιππος ‘horse-taming’ (Orph. Argonau-
tica), θειόδαμος ‘taming the gods’ (Orac. ap. Porph.), ἀργυροδάμας ‘name of a
precious stone’ (meaning ‘subduing silver’?, Plin.) and ἀστροδάμας ‘subduing
the stars’ (PGM 4.603). The shape of the FC δάμν-, which preserves the n-infix of
the present, testifies to the late and artificial character of δάμνιππος, a variation
on the more common δαμάσιππος which may have been prompted by the require-
ments of metre.
      The only cases of semantic overlap are the pairs δαμάσιππος/δάμνιππος vs.
ἱππόδαμος (Hom.), Δαμασίᾱς vs. Λᾱοδάμας, and δαμασίμβροτος ‘taming mortals’
(Simon.) vs. ἀνδροδάμας ‘man-taming’ (Pi.). Overall, one gets the impression
that all the forms derived from δάμνημι are associated with highly literary con-
texts. The V2 type in -δαμος has disappeared in MG, where it is replaced by com-
pounds in -δαμαστής; this evolution is connected with the progressive replace-
ment of δάμνημι by δαμάζω in AG, but the parallel development of compounds
in -δαμαστής is not a common phenomenon in AG, where only two forms of this
kind are to be found.26
δέχομαι
The V1 type is far more productive in onomastics than in the appellative lexicon.
Against more than a hundred different PNs in δεξι- collected in the LGPN (the
Corpus only includes one form per type and does not list Kurznamen) stand only
two appellative forms, both of relative antiquity: δεξίστρατος ‘receiving the host’
(Bacch.) and δεξίπυρος ‘receiving fire’ (Eur.). The recessive character of appella-
tives in δεξι- is further confirmed by the fact that both forms are hapax legomena.
25 Io Manolessou, p.c.
26 The sole evidence for the existence of the simplex δαμαστής in AG is a short quotation in the
so-called Fraudes Fulgentianae, from Fulgentius’ Mythologia, which transmits three quotations
attributed to Epicharmus and edited among the Pseudoepicharmeia in K-A (frr. 298–300). In fr.
299 K-A Fulgentius’ Latin transliteration reads damastes heros leonte adinami taleros, rendered
by editors of Epicharmus as δαμαστὴς Ἔρως λεοντείαι δυνάμει θαλερός. It is unclear whether
Fulgentius should be identified with the bishop Fulgentius of Ruspe (sixth century AD). There is
therefore no evidence on which to base a precise date for the form δαμαστής.

276          Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
     This state of affairs is likely to be a consequence of the extreme popular-
ity of V2 compounds in -δοκος and -δοχος, both of which are among the most
numerous categories of compounds with a SC of the CoC-os type. Compounds
in -δοκος are the oldest, starting with ἰοδόκος ‘holding arrows’ in Homer; they
are also frequently attested as PNs. The SC -δοχος is not attested in appellatives
before the fourth c. BC (ξενηδόχος ‘one who receives strangers’ in Menander) and
its onomastic use is limited to a few forms (see e.g. Ξενόδοχος, Thrace, 329 BC;
Πολύδοχος, Western Locris, second c. BC).27 As noted in the Corpus, this pervasive
V2 type is accompanied by a less productive type in -δέκτης which, despite the
early attestation of the simplex δέκτης (Hom.), is mostly post-Classical; it survives
in a a few MG forms (e.g., πανδέκτης, δωροδέκτης), but compounds in -δοχος
remain the most common.
δίδωμι
This family of compounds may have started with an old V1 in δωτι-, whose exist-
ence can be reconstructed on the basis of the Kurzname Δωτώ (Chapter 4, section
8.2). Despite the obvious prominence of the verb ‘to give’, appellative V1 com-
pounds are not only limited but also emerge late: the Classical δωσίδικος ‘refer-
ring disputes to a court’ (Hdt.) is a unique case among a handful of otherwise very
late hapax legomena. Among these, δωσιάρα ‘giving evil’ (Hsch., in the dative
pl. δωσιάραις) may perhaps be a poetic epithet. δωσίπυγος ‘offering the arse’ is
only attested in a lemma in Suid. δ 1482 glossing a line from the epigrammatist
Nicarchus which describes the sexually bold woman. Onomastic compounds are
equally sparse: although Δωσίθεος acquires a high level of productivity, they are
not attested before the fourth century BC.
     The dominant type is therefore the right-oriented one: the wealth of available
agent nouns, the majority attested already in Homer, enabled the formation of
compounds in -δώτης, -δότης and occasionally also in -δώτωρ (βιοδώτωρ in the
Εὐχή of the Orphic Hymns), which were convenient for covering different metri-
cal patterns. V2 compounds of these types are extremely common at all levels of
the ancient language. The explanation for this distribution of the two patterns is
likely to be entirely morphological: V1 compounds in δωσι- were neither backed
up by an s-aorist nor by the action noun δόσις, which has a different vocalic
grade. As a result, the FC δωσι- could not be associated with one of the productive
models for the derivation of τερψίμβροτος compounds.
27 The distribution and productivity of these compounds in the earliest phases of Greek reflect
the fact that δέκομαι is the original form, while δέχομαι is mostly Attic (though it is found in
Homer).

                 3 Competing pairs of V1 and V2 compounds: a contrastive analysis       277
ἐλάω
Compounds derived from this verb exhibit a clear preference for the V2 pattern,
which is attested from Homer onwards (ἱππηλάτης ‘driver of horses’) and remains
productive down to the Byzantine period;28 a few compounds in -ηλάτης are still
used in MG. The early productivity of V2 compounds may be connected to the fact
that the agent noun ἐλατήρ ‘driver’ (Hom.) is of considerable antiquity, and that
a second agent noun ἐλάτης appears in the fifth century BC.
     The SC of V2 compounds can take two forms: -ηλ́της, in which -η- results
from the contraction of the laryngeal at the beginning of the root *h1elh2- and the
linking vowel of the FC, and -ελ́της. The latter is clearly the more recent, both
in terms of linguistic chronology and dates of attestation, starting with αἰγελάτης
‘goatherd’ in Plutarch, and may be analogical on the simplex ἐλ́της: this agent
noun perhaps represents an ‘updating’ of the old ἐλατήρ. A few of these com-
pounds in -ελ́της replace older specimina in -ηλ́της, perhaps not inde-
pendently of metrical factors (cf. ἱππελ́της in Oppian); in the case of those which
are attested in prose texts (the majority), where there is no metre to offer any
clues, it is impossible to ascertain whether they simply replace older compounds
in -ηλ́της. Interestingly, these compounds in -ελ́της have died out in MG, where
the only form assumed by the SC is -ηλάτης: this may be connected with the fact
that the verb itself has disappeared, surviving only in the interjections έλα and
ελάτε ‘come on’, which derive from the present imperative of the ancient verb.
Most of these MG compounds in -ηλάτης are imported from AG and/or high-level
language (e.g. ιχνηλάτης ‘tracker’ or στρατηλάτης ‘inspired military leader’) and
-ηλάτης is not a productive suffix (the common noun ποδηλάτης ‘bicycle rider’ is
a secondary formation from ποδήλατο ‘bicycle’).29
     Given that the V2 pattern is characterized by this degree of productiv-
ity in AG, it will not come as a surprise that V1 compounds are limited to three
forms: ἐλασιβρόντᾱς ‘hurling thunder’, ἐλασίχθων ‘earth-striking’ and the PN
 ̓Ελάσιππος. Both epithets, first used by Pindar, are associated with the seman-
tic sphere of ‘strike, set in motion’ and they share the fate of reappearing only
infrequently in later literature. More surprising is the fact that, in the absence of
compounded PNs ending in -ηλ́της or -ελ́της, the V1 pattern is not exploited
more in onomastics:  ̓Ελάσιππος, perhaps connected with the semantic sphere of
‘drive away, carry off’ (for a syntagm with horses, cf. Il. 5.236), has a mere three
attestations in the corpus provided by the LGPN.30

278          Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
ἕλκω
The competing V1 and V2 types in this family exhibit a telling distribution. V1
compounds are less numerous and are all used as epithets, but they are also more
ancient. ἑλκεχίτων ‘trailing the tunic’ and ἑλκεσίπεπλος ‘trailing the robe’ both
occur in Homer, while the hapax ἑλκετρίβων ‘cloak-trailer’ in Plato Comicus, a
clear instance of wordplay on the epic forms, appears in a fragment in which
other novel compounds of a high-sounding but ultimately disparaging nature,
including σπαρτιοχαίτης ‘with ropy hair’ and ῥυποκόνδυλος ‘with dirty knuck-
les’, are used to describe a Laconian character.31 The epic flavour of ἑλκεχίτων
and ἑλκεσίπεπλος is also confirmed by the fact that they are not used outside
early lyric poetry, late-antique epic or scholarly discussions of Homeric passages.
     V2 compounds are more numerous but are also younger in origin. They begin
with τοξουλκός and ξιφουλκός in Aeschylus, but most of the numerous specimina
come from a much later period. None of them represents the right-oriented coun-
terpart of a V1 compound: there are no overlaps between the two patterns. έλκω
survives in MG only as a learned resurrection, and this explains why compounds
in -ουλκος are limited and of a similarly learned nature: apart from the Neoclassi-
cal compound εμβρυουλκός ‘forceps’, used in the technical lexicon of obstetrics,
the few standard words such as ρυμουλκός ‘towing’ and its derivation ρυμουλκό
‘tug’ and βαρούλκο ‘winch, crank’ would not be associated with έλκω by most
speakers, since the ablaut pattern is no longer available in the MG verb έλκω.
ἔρδω
V2 compounds in -ουργός and -εργός are amongst the most productive in the
whole of Greek linguistic history, and this despite the fact that speakers could
not trace them back to a homophonic verb **ἔργω.32 From a historical point of
view, the two shapes assumed by the SC are the result of two different processes.
-ο-oργος (where the first [o] belongs to the FC, but through contraction yields
the common SCs -ουργός and -ωργός) originally identified verbal compounds. On
the other hand, the SC -ο-εργος originally characterized bahuvrihi compounds
derived from ἔργον ‘work’.33
31 On these forms, see Pirrotta (2009: 266–267).
32 The present ἔρδω, attested in Homer, derives from the e-grade of the root which in Mycenae-
an produces the zero-grade present *wr̥g̑-jō, attested in the form wo-ze (where [o] therefore is
the outcome of *r̥). In Attic Greek, ἔρδω is replaced by synonyms such as ποιέω, ἐργάζομαι and
πράττω, but it survives in other dialects, e.g. Cretan. Another present formation, *werg̑-jō, sur-
vives in ῥέζω, which is more commonly found in Attic authors, though not in prose.

               3 Competing pairs of V1 and V2 compounds: a contrastive analysis      279
     As Bader (1965) has shown, this repartition was perturbed already in the
early stages of Greek. Homeric language features some agentive compounds in
-ο-εργός, which replace the original and uncontracted agentive compounds in
-ο-οργός and soon spread to other dactylic poetry, and later also to prose. Further
confusion was created by the fact that both -ο-εργός and -ο-οργός (whatever the
structure of the compound) were contracted into -ουργός. This series of develop-
ments also triggered the creation of a class of compounds in -ουργ́ς from those
in -εργ́ς, which are passive in origin, but later acquired active semantics (though
active forms in -ουργ́ς are rare): on these, see section 4.3 below.34
     Given the considerable popularity of the entire family of V2 compounds
derived from ἔρδω, it is not surprising that V1 forms are sparse, limited to the ono-
mastic lexicon and formed on the stem of the s-aorist ( ̓Ερξικλείδης,  ̓́Ερξανδρος,
etc.). V1 compounds derived from ἐργάζομαι are similarly rare: cf. Chapter
5, section 5.3.2. The V2 type in -ουργός has died out in MG, where it has been
replaced by forms in -εργάτης, corresponding to the present εργάζομαι.
ἔχω
Both V1 and V2 compounds derived from this verb are extremely productive and
both patterns have been used in Greek from Mycenaean until the present. The
V1 structure has more individual entries in onomastics, whereas V2 forms are far
more frequent in the appellative lexicon. Appellative V1 compounds, however,
do not just feature in poetry (starting with ἐχέθυμος ‘under self-control’ and
ἐχέφρων ‘prudent’ in Homer, both still used in MG), but also appear in prose: see
ἐκεχειρία ‘truce’ (< * ἐχε-χειρία after dissimilation of the first aspirated stop; Thuc.
and inscriptions), ἐχέκολλος ‘sticky’ (Hipp.), ἐχεμυθία ‘silence’ (Plu.), ἐχεδερμία
‘being hide-bound’ (Hippiatr.), ἐχέσαρκος ‘clinging close to the body’ (Ath.), and
ἐχεπάμων ‘holding property’, attested in inscriptions from Lokroi.
     The right-oriented type in -οχος/-ουχος, already used to characterize an
individual in Mycenaean (ko-to-no-o-ko /ktoino-okhos/, in all likelihood a ‘land
holder’), is one of the most popular V2 categories and survives into MG. Substan-
tives are also attested in Homer with forms such as ἡνίοχος ‘one who holds the
reins, charioteer’, while an early adjective is σκηπτοῦχος ‘bearing a sceptre’, an
epithet of kings in Homeric epic. Semantic overlap between the two types of com-
pounds is to be found in the following two pairs only: the Myc. PN e-ke-da-mo vs.
δημοῦχος (the meaning ‘possessor of the land’, attested in Sophocles, may apply
in the case of the Myc. form too), and  ̓Εχέπολις vs. πολιοῦχος ‘protecting a city’
(attested in Homer as πολιήοχος).

280          Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
ἡγέομαι
This is another old and productive compound family. V1 compounds are extremely
common in the onomastic lexicon, appearing as early as the seventh century BC.
It is less easy to ascertain whether PNs derived from ἡγέομαι existed in Myce-
naean, but the two PNs in a-ke- are more likely to derive from ἄρχω (see the anal-
ysis above). Because of the close similarity of forms derived from ἡγέομαι and
from ἄγω outside Attic-Ionic and in contexts where it is not possible to determine
the quantity and aspiration of the initial vowel, a number of compounds in ἀγε-
attested in prose and in inscriptions may well belong with ἡγέομαι instead. At
any rate, both ἡγέομαι and ἄγω are unproductive sources of V1 appellatives (see
above), a fact which is only partially explicable with reference to the popularity
of the V2 pattern.
     V2 compounds derived from ἡγέομαι present interpretative difficulties of a
similar kind to the V1 compounds. The SC -ᾱγέτης/-ηγέτης could in principle
derive from ἄγω, through Wackernagel’s Dehnungsgesetz (on which see Chapter
1, section 4.2). Such a view is maintained, for instance, by Ruijgh (1967: 119), fol-
lowed by EDG s.v. ἄγω (though without accepting Ruijgh’s hypothesis that the
regular reflex of *h2o- in Greek was [a]).35 Chantraine’s view, on the other hand, is
that compounds in -ᾱγός/-ηγός derive from ἄγω, while those in -ᾱγέτης/-ηγέτης
derive from ἡγέομαι.36 Since the two verbs are very close in meaning, it may well
be that speakers did not in fact operate a clear-cut distinction between the two
compound types, particularly since the initial aspiration of SCs from ἡγέομαι is
likely to have been articulated very feebly already in Classical Greek. What might
encourage us to favour Chantraine’s idea that compounds in ᾱγέτης/-ηγέτης are
linked to ἡγέομαι, if anything, is the fact that this verb would otherwise lack com-
pound derivatives, given that the V1 pattern is almost exclusive to the onomastic
lexicon.
ἵστημι
Compounds derived from ἵστημι exhibit a neat repartition. V1 compounds are
exclusively onomastic: the FC Στησι- conveys the transitive-causative seman-
tics of the s-aorist, e.g. in Στησίχορος ‘he who sets up a chorus’ or Στήσιππος
‘he who makes the horse stand’.37 V2 compounds, on the other hand, tend to
express the intransitive meaning of the verb (‘stand’). Consider, for instance, the
small group of forms identifying chorus members: ἀριστεροστάτης ‘standing on
35 See too Wackernagel (1889: 39), Fraenkel (1910: 59–62).
36 Chantraine (1956: 91), DEG s.v. ἡγέομαι. Chantraine (1956: 90) also criticizes the idea (going
back to Meillet) that both -ᾱγέτης/-ηγέτης and -ηγός derive from ἡγέομαι.

the left’, πρωτοστάτης ‘one who stands first’, τριτοστάτης ‘standing third from
the corypheus’, δεξιοστάτης ‘one who stands in the right file of the chorus’ and
δευτεροστάτης ‘one who stands in the rear file of the chorus’. In each case the
FC serves as an adjective qualifying the SC and, in syntactic terms, expresses a
spatial or temporal modification of the verb. This structure involving an adjecti-
val FC is shared by ὀρθοστάτης ‘upright shaft’, τριστάτης ‘one who stands third
(next to the king and queen)’ and μεσοστάτης ‘inner beam’. Similarly, the FC of
πυριστάτης ‘standing on the fire’ expresses a spatial modification.
     A smaller group of V2 compounds express the transitive meaning of ἵστημι and
their FCs take on the semantic role of the object: ὀβολοστάτης ‘weigher of obols’,
ζυγοστάτης ‘one who sets up the beam of the balance, weigher’ and χοροστάτᾱς
‘one who sets up the chorus, chorus-leader’. In this compound family, therefore,
the V1 orientation tends to be selected to express the verb’s transitive and transi-
tive-causative semantics, while the V2 structure is mostly used when the intransi-
tive meaning is required. As with most other pairs in this subgroup, however, the
V1 type is limited to onomastics: the relevant semantic distinction does not seem
to have been needed in the onomastic lexicon, where the few V2 compounds in
-στάτης, too, express the transitive and transitive-causative meaning of the verb.
κλέπτω
This verb features in a handful of V1 compounds whose FCs convey the idea of
‘stealing’, though a few later forms in κλεψι- are based on the other meaning of
κλέπτω, ‘conceal’: see e.g. κλεψιχώλος ‘disguising lameness’ (Luc., a hapax).
These V1 compounds are typically epithets and rather recherché in character (e.g.
κλεψίνυμφος [steal wife] > ‘seeking illicit love’ in Lycophron, or κλεψίτοκος ‘con-
cealing offspring’ in Oppian and attested only another time in Nonnus). Other
forms have a reasonably high level of productivity, such as κλεψύδρα, the name
of a relatively common object; κλεψίαμβος, indicating a nine-string musical
instrument; κλεψίγαμος [steal marriage] > ‘seeking illicit love’ (Orac. Sib.), which
has a second life in Christian authors like Eusebius; and κλεψίνοος ‘beguiling
the mind’, which again is rather popular with Christian authors and particularly
favoured by Nonnus.
     V2 compounds are more numerous. The old root compounds in -κλεψ and
the CoC-os compounds in -κλόπος are recessive types, which from the late Clas-
sical age onwards begin to be replaced by compounded forms of the agent noun
κλέπτης (Hom.). The root noun κλώψ (Soph.) does not yield compounds. The fact
that βοόκλεψ ‘stealer of oxen’ (and its contracted form βοῦκλεψ) and τυρόκλεψ
‘cheese-thief’ are mostly attested in grammatical sources confirms their reces-
sive status, since it is for this very reason that the grammarians are prompted
to discuss their derivational pattern. Similarly, all compounds in -κλόπος are

restricted to less than ten attestations each: ἀνδραποδοκλόπος ‘slave-stealer’ is
basically a hapax, transmitted by Photius with an attribution to Sophocles (hence
its entry in LSJ as a Sophoclean word); κυνοκλόπος ‘dog-stealer’ seems to be Aris-
tophanes’ creation, later only found in lexicographical texts; φρενοκλόπος ‘steal-
ing the understanding’ is a hapax; πανεπίκλοπος ‘all-treacherous’ is found only
in Oppian and the scholia to the Halieutica; γαμοκλόπος ‘adulterous’ is a rela-
tively common form in later epic, particularly in Nonnus; βουκλόπος ‘ox-stealing’
too is a late-epic form.
     Compounds in -κλέπτης are much more numerous, but the productivity of
each individual compound is low and are words whose subsequent attestations
after their appearance in a given author are solely of a lexicographical nature: these
are Menander’s ἀνδραποδοκλέπτης ‘slave-stealer’, Theocritus’ κηριοκλέπτης
‘stealer of honeycombs’, Lycophron’s λαμπτηροκλέπτης ‘lamp-stealer’ and
ζωστηροκλέπτης ‘one who steals belts’, Heroda’s ὀρνιθοκλέπτης ‘bird-stealer’,
Athenaeus’ ψηφοκλέπτης [pebble stealer] > ‘one who juggles with pebbles’, Dio-
genes Laertius’ ἱματιοκλέπτης ‘clothes-stealer’ and πορφυροκλέπτης ‘stealer of
purple’, Lucillius’ νυκτικλέπτης ‘thief of the night’, and ἀσημοκλέπτης ‘thief of
plate’ in AP 11.360.3. ὀφθαλμοκλέπτης ‘stealer of the eye’ in the scholia to Lyco-
phron and παιδοκλέπτης ‘stealer of children’ in the scholia to Callimachus are
hapax legomena or words whose subsequent attestations are merely lexicograph-
ical. Similarly, ποτηριοκλέπτης ‘cup-stealer’, the title of a play by Euphorion of
Chalcis, is only attested as such and does not have a life of its own. Although
these compounds are found in literature and poetry, in some cases we are dealing
with authors whose language is supposed to have been closer to lower registers
(e.g. Menander, Herodas). At the same time, their appearance in the scholia
can be seen as a sign that compounds in -κλέπτης were associated with more
common language (see also μικροκλέπτης ‘petty thief’, which has two attesta-
tions in scholiographical sources). This supposition is further supported by the
fact that κλέπτης, its standard modern form κλέφτης, and their compounds
are preserved and indeed commonly attested in MG (some, like καρδιοκλέφτης
‘stealer of hearts’, may even be demotic). Forms in -κλοπος, on the other hand, are
rare, with λογοκλόπος ‘plagiarist’ being the only standard form of this kind.38 The
choice between these agentive SCs was probably prompted not only by fashion (it
is true that forms in -κλεψ cease to be productive early on, in contrast to the later
productivity of those in -κλέπτης) but also by practical needs: the three SCs are
suited to different metrical shapes.
38 I am grateful to Io Manolessou for correcting my views on forms such as τυποκλοπία ‘piracy’,

               3 Competing pairs of V1 and V2 compounds: a contrastive analysis      283
     In comparison to V2 compounds, where we do not find a single item with a
high level of productivity, certain V1 compounds seem to have been more popular:
this is suggested at least by the higher number of attestations of κλεψύδρα,
κλεψίαμβος, κλεψίγαμος and κλεψίνοος. In this case, therefore, the V1 type seems
to have enjoyed greater popularity, at least in certain registers.
λύω
This verb is an extremely popular source of V1 compounds, which are particu-
larly productive in onomastics. Amongst the appellative specimina, a few forms
such as λυσιτελέω ‘indemnify for expenses incurred’ (preserved in MG), λυσιγυῖα
‘relaxation of the limbs’ and λυσιπόλεμος ‘type of war-engine’ seem to have been
created outside poetry. Moreover, most of the appellative V1 compounds enjoy
a relatively high level of productivity, and this applies even to those that were
created in later Greek. The only exceptions are λυσιγυῖα (a hapax in Hippocrates),
λυσίκακος (first attested in Theognis and later used only by Hesychius as an inter-
pretamentum of λαθικηδές) and λυσιπόλεμος (a hapax).
     The popularity of the V1 type in both onomastics and the appellative lexicon
may be responsible for the unproductive character of the V2 compounds, with
the lack of an agentive simplex perhaps an additional factor. The semantics of
ὠδινολύτης ‘setting free from pain’ (Plin.) and νουσολύτης ‘freeing from illness’
(Ep. Gr. 1026) is close to that of the V1 compounds λυσίπονος ‘releasing from pain’
(Pi.) and λυσιμέριμνος ‘driving care away’ (AP). However, in contrast to the strong
productivity of the V1 compounds, V2 forms derived from λύω are either hapax
legomena (ὠδινολύτης, νουσολύτης and κομβολύτης ‘cut-purse’) or attested in
very late sources (χρησμολύτης ‘expounder of oracles’ in Gregory of Antiochia
and Tzetzes). The type survives in a few MG forms, although these are hardly
standard: τουρκοκαταλύτης ‘destroyer of the Turks’ is a poetic word, coined in
the nineteenth century. Its SC is the prefixed agent noun καταλύτης, which as a
simplex is used only in the technical sense of ‘catalyst’ or ‘converter’. The fact that
its compounds preserve the AG meaning of ‘destroyer’ reveals their poetic and
learned nature: most compounds in -καταλύτης are demotic creations and not to
be found in contemporary Standard MG.
στρέφω
This compound family exhibits a clear preference for the V2 pattern, as is usually
the case with ablauting roots preserving a CoC-os agent noun or V2 type. Out
of six V1 compounds, two are PNs. Of these, Στρεψιππίδᾱς has a transparent
meaning, corresponding to e.g. Il. 8.168 ἵππους τε στρέψαι ‘to turn horses’: ‘he
who makes the horses turn’.

284          Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
     The appellative compounds mostly have an artificial structure. στρεφεδινέω
‘whirl round’ is assumed to derive from the unattested compound **στρεφεδίνης,
in much the same way as the participial masculine form δυσμενέων is created
from δυσμενής.39 The semantics of στρεφεδινέω is also artificial in that, rather
than assuming the role of the object, the SC derived from δίνη ‘whirlwind, rota-
tion’ seems instead to qualify the verbal action of the FC: ‘whirl in rotation’.40
     Another artificial compound is στρεψίμαλλος ‘with tangled fleece’ (Aris-
toph. fr. 682 K-A), whose verbal FC expresses passive semantics. It seems to have
been coined following the model of an equally artificial Homeric compound,
πηγεσίμαλλος ‘with compressed fleece’ (see the analysis below), and is being
used to characterize Euripides’ dramatic art, but the incomplete context of this
one-line fragment makes it impossible to judge whether an allusion to Homer was
intended by Aristophanes; the meaning of στρεψίμαλλος was probably disparag-
ing.41 Similarly, the name of the African antelope attested in Pliny, στρεψίκερως,
implies an adjectival and therefore passive understanding of the FC, ‘having
twisted horns’: it describes the Greater Kudu, whose modern scientific name,
Tragelaphus strepsiceros, retains the old Greek compound.
     στρεψοδικοπανουργία ‘cunning in the perversion of justice’, a typically
extended comic compound, and στρεψοδικέω ‘pervert justice’ are both Aristo-
phanes’ creations, and were probably coined as neat counterparts to Strepsiades’
own name, itself allusive.42 Another compound, the hapax στρεψαύχην ‘twist-
ing the neck’, features in Theompompus’ fr. 55 K-A, transmitted by Athenaeus in
the context of a discussion dealing with drinking-vessels. It qualifies a κώθων,
a Laconian vase apparently typical of soldiers (the title of Theopompus’ play
is Στρατιώτιδες, ‘Female soldiers’), whose shape was designed to prevent the
content from spilling.
     It is apparent, then, that V1 compounds derived from στρέφω are of limited
productivity and display various artificial features: this group thus neatly brings
out the tendency of V1 compounds to surface in poetic, comic or scientific lan-
39 For a different view on the origin of many of these -εω verbs, which holds that they represent
early cases of incorporation, see Grandi and Pompei (2012).
40 The derivational process is analysed by Tucker (1990: 62–72); on the Homeric form
στρεφεδίνηθεν in particular, see Risch (1974: 181), Meissner (2006: 213 n. 122).
41 See the comment in Eust. in Od. 1.354.33–34: στρεψιμάλλους ἐκάλουν οἱ παλαιοὶ τοὺς
περιλαλοῦντας καὶ κακοσχόλως φράζοντας, λαβόντες τὸ σκῶμμα ἀπὸ ἐρίων συνεστραμμένους
μαλλοὺς ἐχόντων καὶ οὕτω δυσλύτων ‘the ancients called στρεψίμαλλοι those who talked a lot
and said mischievous things: they derived the pun from the flocks whose wool was entangled
and had not been washed’. All passages commenting on this compound confirm that the FC has
a passive meaning: see also Hsch. σ 1997, Ph. s.v.
42 Kanavou (2011: 67–68).

guage (see section 6). The V2 pattern is much the more productive, but as far
as we can judge from the compounds attested before the third century BC, it is
mostly used in poetic language: οἰακοστρόφος ‘helmsman’ is used only by Pindar,
Aeschylus, Euripides and Gregory of Nazianzus; ἀσπιδηστρόφος ‘shield-wield-
ing’, the original MS reading for the current ἀσπιδηφόρος at Aesch. Ag. 825, would
be a hapax;43 ἡνιοστρόφος ‘charioteer’ is a Sophoclean hapax; Aristophanes’
ἱμονιοστρόφος ‘water-drawer’ is later only quoted by lexicographers; and The-
ocritus’ ἑδροστρόφος ‘(wrestler) who throws his adversary’ is another hapax.
Even accounting for the fact that V2 compounds are more numerous, this com-
pound family as a whole is a highly literary one in character. στρέφω and com-
pounds in -στροφος survive into MG, with standard forms such as the opposites
δεξιόστροφος / αριστερόστροφος ‘which turns to the right/left’ and αργόστροφος
‘whose mind turns slowly, stupid’ / εύστροφος ‘whose mind turns quickly, intelli-
gent’, in both of which the FC has an adverbial meaning.
σώζω
This common compound family displays a clear-cut repartition. With the excep-
tion of the epithet σωσ́πολις, all the V1 compounds are PNs, adding up to nine-
ty-seven different items in the LGPN database.44 Some of the names have trans-
parent semantics: see for instance the very popular Σωσίβιος ‘one who saves
lives’, Σώσιππος ‘one who saves horses’, Σωσιβώτᾱς ‘one who saves cattle’,
Σωσιγένης ‘one who saves his family’, Σωσίδημος and Σωσίλᾱος both ‘one who
saves his people’, Σωσίστρατος ‘one who saves the army’, etc. The appellative
form σωσ́πολις, which is also used as a PN, is not particularly common: it only
features in Aristophanes, Strabo and Hesychius.
     All the V2 compounds, on the other hand, are appellative, though they
begin to appear only in the Hellenistic age and usually have few attestations.
Their formation was probably hindered by the fact that the SC -(σ)σόος is also
characteristic of compounds derived from σεύω ‘chase’. If we focus solely on
the distribution of the forms attested before the third century BC collected in the
Corpus, we note both their low popularity in the Classical age and their increased
use in late-antique poets. κουροσόος ‘child-saving’, used by the epigramma-
tist Perses, is a hapax; μηλοσσόος ‘sheep-protecting’ has only two attestations
outside lexicographical sources; πολισσόος ‘protecting the city’ (H. Hom. Mart. 2)
and μελισσοσόος ‘preserver of bees’ (Zonas Epigr.) are hapax legomena; οἰκοσόος
(Max. Astrol.) has only two attestations; βιοσσόος is used only by Nonnus;

ξενοσσόος (Nonn.) is another hapax; ψυχοσσόος is found only in Nonnus and
in two epigrams of the Anthologia Palatina; βροτοσσόος is mostly discussed in
grammatical sources dealing with accentuation; δημοσσόος is a hapax in Hes-
ychius, where it is glossed with two opposite meanings: τὸν δῆμον σώζων ‘one
who saves the people’ (i.e. as if it were a V2 compound derived from σώζω) and ὁ
δημοδίωκτος ‘he who is chased/banished by the people’ (i.e. as if it were a passive
V2 compound derived from σεύω). Many of these late V2 compounds are mirror
images of older V1 PNs: see the pairs Σωσίβιος and βιοσσόος, Σωσίδημος and
δημοσσόος Σωσίμβροτος and βροτοσσόος, σωσ́πολις and πολισσόος, Σωσίξενος
and ξεινοσσόος, Σωσίνεως and νηοσσόος (attested in Apollonius Rhodius but not
included in the Corpus). As noted in section 2.1, the agent noun σωτήρ does not
give rise to agentive compounds in AG but its modern form, σωτήρας, does.
φαγεῖν
Compounds in -φαγος, deriving from the PIE root which supplies the aorist
stem of the Greek verb ‘to eat’, are amongst the most common in both Ancient
and Modern Greek.45 There is no real V1 counterpart to these: the only attested
form is φαγέσωρος ‘glutton’, which has been transmitted to us as an anonymous
comic fragment (adesp. 786 K-A) by Pollux, together with the feminine form
φαγεσωρῖτις; its SC derives from σωρός ‘heap, quantity’. There is therefore no
competition between the two compound patterns: V2 compounds, as we might
expect, are the dominant type, and this continues to be the case in MG.
φέρω
This compound family examplifies the trends which characterize the interaction
of V1 and V2 competing types more generally. V1 compounds are both appellative
and onomastic, but V1 appellatives sometimes contain the artificial FCs φερεσι-
and φερεσ-, and these are never attested in PNs. V2 forms are also used as PNs,
though the overwhelming majority belongs to the appellative lexicon. Com-
pounds in -φορος remain highly productive in MG, and we even find a few forms
in φερε- preserved or newly introduced: see φερέγγυος ‘giving surety’, φέρελπις
‘producing hope’, φερέφωνο ‘mouthpiece, spokesman’ (< Fr. porteparole). The
non-verbal constituents of the two types of compounds frequently overlap, as the
number of pairs testifies: an analysis of their history may thus serve as a useful
source of insights into the interaction of V1 and V2 patterns.
    Let us start with the most famous pair of all, φερέοικος ‘house carrier, snail’
(Hes.) vs. οἰκοφόρος ‘bearing one’s house’ (Ps. Scymn.). φερέοικος is sparingly
used, except in Hesiod (epithet of the snail), Herodotus (to describe the living

habits of the Scythians) and Plutarch (for a type of wasp). It subsequently fea-
tures only in grammatical sources, before resurfacing in Nonnus and Gregory of
Nazianzus. Although limited, this is in fact a quite high rate of use compared to
that of οἰκοφόρος: as far as we can tell, it only features in Ps. Scymn. 854 (= Peripl.
M. Eux. 49) to describe the habits of nomadic peoples. Even as far as usage in
context is concerned, οἰκοφόρος is the exact counterpart of φερέοικος, differen-
tiated solely by the fact of being more recent and much rarer. An investigation of
the contexts in which individual forms are attested disproves Benveniste’s thesis
that forms in -φορος identify a ‘porteur par vocation ou nature’, i.e. express a
definition, while those in φερε- express a description:46 suffice it to note that both
φερέοικος and οἰκοφόρος are used as epithets of nomadic peoples.
     Such a distribution, with the V1 compound being older and more frequently
used than its V2 counterpart, also characterizes other pairs derived from φέρω.
φέρασπις ‘shield-bearing’ first appears in Aeschylus’ Persae and Agamemnon,
and is subsequently only employed in the late Homeric hymn to Ares and by Pro-
clus.47 However, its counterpart ἀσπιδοφόρος is attested for the first time in the
late-antique author Theodoretus of Cyrrha. In the case of other pairs, the V1 com-
pound, although older, has fewer attestations than the V2 one. φερέζυγος ‘bearing
the yoke’ is a very likely emendation in Alc. fr. 249.3 Voigt and is later only used
by Ibycus and Proclus, while ζυγοφόρος appears in Eur. HF 121 (the manuscript
reading is ζυγηφόρος), and later only in Plutarch and Athanasius. φερεστέφανος
‘bringing victory’ is only attested in Bacchylides, whereas στεφανηφόρος is found
in a large number of texts beginning with Herodotus and Euripides.
     Finally, there are pairs in which the V2 type is both older and more produc-
tive. σακεσφόρος ‘shield bearing’ has a few attestations in lyric, tragic and comic
poets of the fifth century, before becoming a word of interest to lexicographers.
φερεσσακής on the other hand is a rare and mostly late form, attested in the Pseu-
do-Hesiodic Shield, in Tryphiodorus and Nonnus, and then in an epic adespoton
of the seventh century AD (Heitsch 40). καρποφόρος ‘yielding fruit’ has more
than a hundred attestations, starting with Pindar, while φερέκαρπος is used only
by Plutarch and Nonnus. σταφυλοφόρος, which features in Aristotle’s Historia
animalium as a seemingly technical term to describe the uvula (= σταφυλή), is
used again only by Rufus and Pollux, while φερεστάφυλος ‘bearing bunches of
grapes’ is attested in Archestratus Parodius (quoted by Athenaeus) and Oppian.
Finally, φερέπτερυξ ‘bearing wings’ is a hapax in Oppian, as is πτερυγοφόρος in
Dioscorides.

     All the forms in the pairs considered above seem to have belonged to a highly
literary, and usually poetic, register. The exceptions are οἰκοφόρος, used to char-
acterize nomadic peoples, and the ‘scientific’ term σταφυλοφόρος. If this tells us
anything about the distribution of the V1 and V2 patterns, it is perhaps that we
ought to be more cautious in attributing the former to poetic registers and the
latter to more common, ‘everyday’ Greek. While it is true that, throughout the
whole linguistic history of Greek, V2 compounds in -φόρος are the source of many
common terms, it is not the case that they are restricted to less poetic registers
than the V1 compounds: the competing pairs display, by and large, a similar dis-
tribution across the two types.
     Similarly, it would be wrong to attribute chronological precedence to one of
the two types. An even distribution is discernible across the different competing
pairs, with three cases of a V1 compound being older, two cases of simultaneity,
and three cases where it is the V2 compound which is older. It may instead be more
fruitful to interpret the evidence as suggesting that the V1 form is, by and large,
less frequently used. The exceptions to this trend are φερέοικος and φέρασπις,
which have more attestations than οἰκοφόρος and ἀσπιδοφόρος respectively.
3.1.1 Summary of characteristics
Most of the productive compound families in this subgroup contain V2 com-
pounds in -ος (the κουροτρόφος/στρατηγός types). The exceptions are the
families derived from δίδωμι, ἐλάω, ἡγέομαι, ἵστημι and λύω, which have com-
pounds in -της, and κλέπτω, which has some V2 compounds in -της as well as
compounds in -ος and root formations. In general, all these V2 compounds are
extremely numerous and there is a clear correlation between their productiv-
ity and the limited number of corresponding V1 compounds: this productivity
may have had an impact on the development of parallel V1 compounds, which
remain more limited even when they are very old in origin (e.g. those derived from
ἄγω or ἕλκω). There is a clear tendency for the V1 compounds in this class to be
extremely productive in onomastics (see those derived from ἄγω, ἄρχω, δάμνημι/
δαμάζω, δέχομαι, ἡγέομαι) or indeed exclusively onomastic (ἔρδω).
     These families therefore confirm the general Greek trend towards right-ori-
ented compounds: in connection with the extremely productive agentive type in
-ος, V2 compounds are more numerous, and many serve as names of professions
or as adjectives describing objects of common use. V1 compounds are rarer, and
often feature exclusively in poetic language or become specialized as PNs. This
distribution provides a likely explanation of the fact that in most previous studies
V1 compounds have been treated as a predominantly onomastic type. Indeed,
many of these seventeen base verbs are among the most productive sources of

                3 Competing pairs of V1 and V2 compounds: a contrastive analysis      289
verbal compounds: if we were to ground our conception of the entire V1 type on
the behaviour of ἄγω, ἄρχω, δέχομαι, ἔχω, ἔρδω or φέρω, it would be natural to
conclude that V1 compounds have become specialized as an onomastic type and
are perhaps even a relic, no longer productive as a means of word formation. For
instance, within the corpus of Mycenaean V1 compounds collected in Tables 4.2
and 4.3, possible names derived from ἄρχω and ἔχω amount to three and four
respectively: this means that PNs in Ἀρχε- and Ἐχε- may together account for one
third of the whole Myc. corpus of φερέοικος compounds. However, this need not
mean that in Mycenaean compounds derived from ἄρχω and ἔχω were exclusively
onomastic since (as mentioned in Chapter 3, apropos of Frei-Lüthy’s hypothesis)
the Mycenaean evidence is limited and the supposed specialization of V1 com-
pounds as an onomastic type amounts to an argumentum e silentio, namely the
fact that in the tablets there are no appellative V1 compounds. If we go beyond the
Mycenaean evidence, we see that in later Greek compounds derived from ἄρχω
and ἔχω—as well as those derived from the two other common verbs ἄγω and
φέρω—may also give rise to appellatives, even though they are predominantly
productive in onomastics. In the Homeric poems, the FC ἀρχε- features in two PNs
(Ἀρχέλοχος and Ἀρχεπτόλεμος) and in the adjective ἀρχέκακος, whereas the FC
ἐχε- features in five PNs (Ἐχέπωλος, Ἐχέμμων, Ἐχεκλῆς, Ἐχέφρων, Ἐχένηος) and
in three appellatives (ἐχεπευκ́ς, ἐχέφρων, ἐχέθυμος). ἄγω produces both PNs
and appellatives in Homeric Greek, whereas φέρω seems to have developed later:
in Homer there is only a Kurzname, Φέρεκλος (Il. 5.59), and appellatives appear
only in Hesiod and in the Homeric Hymns (φερέοικος ‘house carrying, φερέσβιος
‘giving life’, φερεσανθής ‘bringing flowers’).
     In conclusion, V1 compounds derived from ἄρχω, ἔχω and φέρω are not
exclusively onomastic and are useful to contravene the general behavioural pat-
terns associated with the seventeen verbs collected in this section. This is perhaps
connected with the semantics of the base verbs, which identify common transi-
tive actions, a feature which may have contributed to the creation of appellative
V1 compounds despite the existence of a productive V2 counterpart.
3.2 Less productive compound families
As anticipated above, the compound families in this subgroup are characterized
by features which allow us to separate them from those of the previous subgroup.
The first feature is that one of the two patterns (but often both) is of low produc-
tivity: this is usually the case with V1 compounds, but there also are families in
which the V1 pattern is more productive than the V2 pattern. The second feature
is that the interaction between the two types often betrays a certain artificiality,

290           Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
with one pattern seemingly influencing the other. The creation and structure of
individual V1 compounds in particular may be influenced by metrical require-
ments or wordplay (the latter is especially common in comic language).
ἀγείρω
The compound family derived from this verb provides a good example of one of
the phenomena which characterize the creation of V1 compounds vis-à-vis V2
compounds: wordplay. As we might expect, V2 compounds are the productive
type, though they are mostly limited to the formation of poetic epithets such
as νεφεληγερέτα ‘cloud-gatherer’: the old Myc. form ri-na-ko-ro /lināgoros/
‘flax-gatherer’ and the later name of the Heraclean official σιταγέρτης ‘collector
of corn’ are the only forms that refer to commonplace activities.
     There is only one V1 compound, ἀγερσικύβηλις, and it is an artificial one. This
hapax is transmitted by Hesychius, who attributes its use to Cratinus (fr. 66 K-A) in
the comedy Drapetides:
     Hsch. α 461: ἀγερσικύβηλις· Κρατῖνος ἐν Δραπέτισιν ἐπὶ Λάμπωνος. τὸν αὐτὸν ἀγύρτην καὶ
     κυβηλιστὴν εἶπεν, οἱονεὶ θύτην καὶ μάντιν. Κύβηλιν γὰρ ἔλεγον τὸν πέλεκυν [...] ὅθεν καὶ
     Λύσιππος ἐν Βάκχαις τὸν αὐτὸν <̔ς> ἀγύρτην κωμῳδεῖ.
     ‘Cratinus [uses ἀγερσικύβηλις] in the Drapetides in reference to Lampon. He calls him
     ‘begging priest’ and ‘axe-wielder’, which is to say, a priest and a diviner. For the name of the
     (sacrificial) axe was κύβηλις [...] for which reason the same man is also ridiculed by Lysippus
     in the Bacchae as a begging-priest.
The interpretamentum connects the constituents of the compound to two rare
words (ἀγύρτης and κυβηλιστής) which are glossed with the common terms
θύτης ‘sacrificer, priest’ and μάντις ‘diviner’ respectively. ἀγύρτης indicated a
kind of mendicant priest who lived on collected offerings (ἀγείρω): this term was
used in particular for the priests of Cybele. The similarity between the goddess’
name and the rare word κύβηλις, indicating the sacrificial axe, seems to have
brought about the misconception that the compound is related to Cybele.48
     The literal translation of ἀγερσικύβηλις as ‘one who collects axes’, retained in
the Corpus for the sake of semantic clarity, probably does not get to the essence of
this comic compound: rather than being a real verbal compound, ἀγερσικύβηλις
is more likely to have been formed by juxtaposing the stem of the action noun
ἄγερσις (Hdt.+), conveying the ideas of collecting and begging, with the stem of
48 In α 146 Photius, who follows Hesychius, also adds the information that others preferred
the reading ἐγερσικύβηλις, explaining the compound as ‘he who raises the axe above/against
himself (τὸν ἐφ’ ἑαυτὸν ἐγείροντα τὸν πέλεκυν).

the ‘technical’ attribute of sacrificing priests, the κύβηλις. The structure of this
compound therefore reveals the impact of -σις nominals on the formation of neol-
ogisms (on which see also Chapter 4, section 4.2).
     The inclusion of ἀγερσικύβηλις in a corpus of V1 compounds is justified by the
fact that, ultimately, V1 compounds provided Cratinus with the structural model on
which to base his comic compound. The playwright was probably keen to impart a
high-sounding quality to the epithet coined for Lampon. This would be consistent
with the style and register of the Drapetides, a comedy which Bakola (2010: 141)
describes as ‘unparalleled in its use of tragedy’: a long V1 compound, composed of
rare words (ἄγερσις is found only three times in AG, κύβηλις is mostly discussed in
grammatical and lexicographical sources) fits the bill perfectly.
     In conclusion, in the family of compounds derived from ἀγείρω the exist-
ence of the odd V1 formation is determined by stylistic factors. ἀγερσικύβηλις is
neither in competition with a specific V2 compound nor a redundant formation:
on the contrary, its existence is fully justified by the stylistic effect intended by
its inventor.
ἀμείβω
Neither type of compound is numerous. V1 PNs can only be reconstructed on the
basis of the Kurzname  ̓Αμειψίας, which corresponds to the FC found in appella-
tive compounds. The extant appellative compounds in ἀμειψι- all seem to have
belonged to scientific language. Two, ἀμειψικοσμίη ‘change of condition’ and
ἀμειψιρρυσμία ‘change of form’, are attributed to Democritus on the testimony of
Hesychius and Diogenes Laertius (9.47; see too Hsch. α 3563 ἀμειψιρυσμεῖν); Hes-
ychius α 3564 is also the source of a third unattributed form, ἀμείψιχρον, prob-
ably corresponding to ἀμειψίχρουν, the accusative of the adjective ἀμειψίχρους
‘changing colour’. The interpretamentum μεταβάλλοντα is in the accusative as
well, to which Latte adds <τὴν χρόαν> (‘the skin’). In Phryn. Ecl. 408 we find a
parallel for the construction of ἀμείβω with χρώς: καὶ τόπον ἀλλάσσειν διά τε
χρόα φανὸν ἀμείβειν (the subject is the things that mortals suppose ‘to change
their place and alter their bright appearance’). ἀμείψιχρους may thus be another
compound related to science or philosophy. The scientific specialization of com-
pounds in ἀμειψι- is confirmed by the fact that the only form of this type in MG is
the botanical technical term αμειψισπορά ‘crop rotation’.
     The V2 compounds of ἀμείβω, on the other hand, all indicate professions or
practical activities. Aeschylus’ χρυσαμοιβός, used as a powerful epithet of Ares,
the god of war who gives gold in exchange for dead bodies, is a famous variation
on the common ἀργυραμοιβός ‘money-changer’, as recognized by the scholia.49
49 See too Fraenkel (1978: 228).

In more homely register, ἀλφιταμοιβός ‘dealer in barley-groats’ is found only
in Aristophanes (three times) and in lexicographical works, where its interpre-
tation is provided: for Pollux the ἀλφιταμοιβοί are οἱ πιπράσκοντες τὰ ἄλφιτα
‘those who sell barley-groats’, while Hesychius offers the synonymic compound,
ἀλφιτοπώλης ‘seller of barley-groats’.
     All these V2 compounds derived from ἀμείβω are associated with Classical
Greek. We see this clearly not only from the fact that almost all of them are not
used after the Classical age, but also from the numerous comments they elicit in
lexicographical sources. ἀργυραμοιβός in particular is quoted a total of ten times
in Atticist lexicography. Phrynichus recommends it as the correct Attic word for
‘money-changer’, against the new word κολλυβιστής, used in less ‘approved’
Attic authors such as Lysias and Menander, and common in the Koine (also see
Moe. α 113).50 This may reflect the fact that ἀμείβω is very much a poetic verb,
whose semantic sphere becomes more restricted with the passing of time, leading
to the current MG meaning of ‘remunerate’. Of the V2 compounds, ἀργυραμοιβός
is the only one to have remained common in the modern language.
ἀκούω
Considering that the numerous forms in -ήκοος are mostly bahuvrihis derived
from ἀκοή ‘hearing’ (a feature preserved in MG), the family of compounds derived
from ἀκούω is a limited one. This is shown first of all by the low productivity of V2
formations, the sole representative of which is the word for ‘spy’, ὠτακουστής.51
V1 compounds are similarly limited, amounting only to the post-Classical
ἀκουσίθεος ‘heard by the gods’, whose passive meaning is also unusual for the
V1 pattern. The context in which ἀκουσίθεος occurs, an epigram by Antipater of
Thessalonica, suggests that it was a recherché word. It is used as the epithet of
φέγγος, the light of a torch sent by Antipater to his patron Pison and accompa-
nied by the short epigram: its light will show that Pison has appreciated the gift
and that Antipater’s prayers will have been ‘heard by the gods’.
ἀραρίσκω
This is an old and recessive compound family, which mirrors the rarity of the base
verb (mostly a poetic word). V1 forms compounded with the root ἀρ- may be as old
as Mycenaean: the interpretation of the PN a-ti-pa-mo as /Artiphāmos/ is phonolog-
50 κολλυβιστής and ἀργυραμοιβός in fact form part of the battleground in the war waged by
Phrynichus against the ‘unacceptable’ language of Menander: see his scathing remarks at Ecl.
408.
51 A later form is the late Byzantine compound πατρακουστής meaning ‘one who listens to the
Father’s word’.

ically possible, although scholars have generally opted for /Antiphāmos/. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 4, sections 7.1 and 8.6, a close semantic parallel for /Artiphāmos/
would be the epithet ἀρτιεπής ‘he who fits together words’. The influence of ἄρτι
‘just’ and ἄρτιος ‘ready’ may already have been felt in connection with these old
specimina, particularly since the element -τι- in the FC was opaque from a morpho-
logical point of view. Moreover, morphological obscurity may have been reinforced
by the fact that speakers were unlikely to have linked most other derivations of
ἀραρίσκω, such as ἅρμα ‘chariot’ or ἄρθμιος ‘allied’, to the verb, with the result that
it probably ceased to be productive from a derivational point of view.
     In the same way, the V2 πυλάρτης ‘gate-fastener’ must have been morpholog-
ically obscure: it remains an isolated formation, which after Homer is taken up
again by Moschus and otherwise by lexicographers. The morphological opacity of
-άρτης is also discernible in the fact that in later Greek a homophonous SC devel-
ops out of ἀείρω/αἴρω ‘lift’, whose regular V2 compounds end in -ορος. In this
connection, it is worth considering another form, the hapax λιθάρτης. It features
in IG 22.1424.col.II.272 as an apposition of καρκίνος, which in the context of the
inscription (an inventory of the treasures of Athena) seems to refer to an object (a
small crab?) made of stone: another possibility is that καρκίνος has the technical
meaning of ‘pair of pincers’ and that λιθάρτης means either ‘assembling stones’
(< ἀραρίσκω) or ‘removing stone’ (< αἴρω), but the preservation of such a techni-
cal object in the treasury of Athena would be more difficult to understand.
ἁρπάζω
This verb creates only two compounds unequivocally of the V1 type, ἁρπάξανδρος
‘snatching away men’ (Aesch.) and ἁρπαξομίλης ‘snatching the pleasures of
sexual intercourse’ (fr. adesp. 597 K–A). The PN Ἁρπάλυκος (Thessaly 3rd c.)
might also be based on this verb: if so, its FC would seem to delete the [g] of the
root. There are no cogent semantic or morphological reasons why V2 compounds
with ἁρπακτής ‘robber’ in the SC should not have been created: we may recall
however that ἁρπακτής, ἁρπακτήρ and ἁρπαστής are all late and rare words (see
section 2.1.5). The only V2 compound, the root formation δελέαρπαξ ‘snapping at
the bait’ (Leon.), is a hapax.
ἀρτύω
This verb mostly creates onomastic compounds which reflect the general
meaning ‘prepare’: see particularly  ̓Αρτύλοχος ‘one who prepares an ambush’,
corresponding to the phrase λόχον ἀρτύναντες (Hom. Od. 14.469, featuring the
epic by-form ἀρτύνω). The only V2 compound, ὀψαρτυτής ‘cook’ (Hyp.), on the
other hand, reflects the specialized meaning ‘prepare a meal’. The simple agent
noun ἀρτυτήρ ‘director’ (IG 12(3).330.144–145, Thera, third c. BC) is a hapax.

294          Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
βαίνω
The productive compounds derived from βαίνω are those in -βάτης. These, like the
simplex βάτης which is only attested in Hesychius, are based on the present and are
thus likely to represent a more recent development than the forms based on the root
βη-, which is the basis of the original verbal formation, the root aorist.52 However,
Homeric Greek already contains some compounds in -βάτης, and this shows that
the new Greek agent nouns in -της could be formed on any vocalic grade.53
     As discussed in Chapter 4, section 8.3, βητάρμων has usually been explained
as an analogical formation on ἐμπυριβήτης, from which it would import not only
the vocalic grade, but also the [t] in the FC. A different explanation has been sug-
gested here: βητάρμων is not an artificial form, but an old compound based on
the bare root and backed-up by the root aorist, the original verbal formation. The
residual nature of compounds in -τι-, together with the Greek creation of the sec-
ondary present formation βαίνω, contributed to the ousting not only of βητάρμων
(whose archaic character can also be defended on the basis of its SC, as discussed
in Chapter 4, section 8.3), but also of compounds in -βήτης, of which ἐμπυριβήτης
is the only example.
     The popularity of the new V2 compounds in -βάτης might have made the cre-
ation of other V1 compounds unnecessary, particularly since both the stem βα-,
featuring in the present, and the stem βη-, featuring in the aorist, end in a vowel, a
fact which makes them less suitable as compound FCs. In the absence of sigmatic
tenses which could provide a FC of the τερψίμβροτος type, the only way to create a
phonologically suitable FC would be to use the whole present stem βαιν-: however,
with the exception of two compounds in φαιν- (see section 4.2), this type of present
stem is not found in V1 compounds, whose FCs also tend to exclude other suffixed
present stems (exceptions are φθινo-, τανυ- and δακν-). The shape of the root is
therefore the very likely cause of the lack of V1 compounds derived from βαίνω and
of the success of V2 forms in -βάτης (which have been preserved into MG).
βλέπω
All forms are rare. βλεπεδαίμων has been preserved for us by Poll. 1.21, with the
comment that it is a comic formation, in the context of a discussion of terms per-
taining to the sacred sphere:
     ὁ δὲ ὑπερτιμῶν δεισιδαίμων καὶ δεισίθεος· κωμικὸν (fr. adesp. 749 K-A) γὰρ ὁ βλεπεδαίμων.
     He who greatly honours the gods [is called] δεισιδαίμων and δεισίθεος [‘fearing the gods’];
     a comic word is βλεπεδαίμων.

               3 Competing pairs of V1 and V2 compounds: a contrastive analysis      295
It is not entirely clear from the context whether we are supposed to understand
βλεπεδαίμων as an afterthought, not directly linked to the topic of the sentence
(terms for the person who honours the gods). In Hsch. β 699 the compound is
glossed with ‘a person who is consumed by illness and whose complexion
is made to look bad by the gods’ (ὁ ὑπὸ νόσου κατεσκληκὼς καὶ κακόχρους
ὑπὸ δαιμόνων). In Eust. in Il. 1.314.31 (with parallels in the Suda and Photius)
βλεπεδαίμων is glossed as ‘a blind person who looks like he has been hit by a
god’ (ὁ διεστραμμένος τὰς ὄψεις καὶ οἷον ὑπὸ δαίμονος πεπληγώς). On the basis
of these two passages, and of Eustathius’ information that according to the Atti-
cist Pausanias βλεπεδαίμων was used to mock the Socratics, the compound has
been loosely interpreted as referring to someone who ‘looks like a ghost’, under-
standing δαίμων with its later meaning of ‘ghost’. Although βλεπεδάμων is a
one-off creation, it does in fact reflect usages of βλέπω followed by a nominative
or accusative with the meaning ‘to look like X’, e.g. φόβον βλέπων ‘looking ter-
rible’ (Aesch. Th. 498), ἔβλεψε νᾶπυ ‘looking mustard’, i.e. ‘giving dark looks’
(Aristoph. Eq. 631).
      What all this reveals is the artificial (and probably comic) character of
βλεπεδαίμων. As noted in section 2.1, the status of the rare V2 compounds
κυνοβλώψ and πολυβλέπων is no more prominent. This is somewhat surprising,
given that βλέπω was a common verb in Greek, still preserved in MG.
βόσκω
In the case of this compound family we cannot really speak of competition
between V1 and V2 compounds. V2 compounds are common, and this is con-
nected to the fact that, as noted in section 2.1.3, βόσκω has a large number of
simple and compounded agentive forms which cover two semantic domains,
namely the idea of ‘nourishing’ and the idea of ‘being a herdsman’.
      The only V1 compound is the Homeric epithet βωτιάνειρα (Chapter 4, section
8.4). Although semantically transparent, βωτιάνειρα must have been felt to
be typical of high poetic language because of the ‘old-fashioned’ shape of the
FC as well of its Homeric associations. It is never found again after Homer and
Hesiod except in grammatical or lexicographical sources. We should also note
that there is no V2 compound conveying the same meaning. As we have seen
with βητάρμων, the rarity of βωτιάνειρα is certainly linked to the shape of the FC,
which could not be replaced by a sigmatic form since there is no s-aorist **ἔβωσα.
The morphological constraints of the root explain both the lack of V1 compounds
and the productivity of V2 compounds.

γιγνώσκω
Despite the very pervasive use of this verb, verbal compounds are limited and
enjoy a certain level of productivity only in onomastics, with the V1 type in Γνωσι-.
In the case of these compounds, it is possible that the popularity of the FC was
enhanced by the existence of the noun γνῶσις ‘knowledge’: see for instance the
example of Γνωσιφίλᾱ, which may be interpreted as ‘one who knows her friends’
but yields a better meaning when construed as ‘one who loves knowledge’. The
influence of γνῶσις is also evident in other non-V1 forms, such as γνωσιμαχέω
‘fight having knowledge of one’s power’ (Hdt.).
     The restriction of V1 compounds to onomastics is not compensated for by the
development of the V2 pattern. As noted in section 2.1, the only V2 compound is
καρδιογνώστης ‘knower of hearts’, attested—just like the agent noun γνώστης—
in the New Testament. It is also used in the Septuagint with the more restricted
meaning of ‘diviner’. It is unclear why verbal compounds derived from γιγνώσκω
are so rare in AG: the type in -γνώστης is more common in MG.54
δάκνω
This is an interesting case of a family of compounds whose character is unmis-
takably literary and artificial and in which the V1 and V2 patterns influence one
another. The starting point is θυμοδακής ‘biting the heart’, used in Homer as an
epithet of μῦθος. For an analysis of this early active form in -ής see section 4.3.1
below. The existence of ὠμοδακής ‘fiercely gnawing’ in Aeschylus (an attribute of
ἵμερος ‘desire’) confirms that the Homeric form is not an oddity.
     If we are to trust the extant sources, θυμοδακής served as the model for the
coinage of the V1 compound δακέθυμος ‘biting the heart’. This is used by Simon-
ides (fr. 74.5 PMG) to characterize the sweat (ἱδρώς) of the man who has reached
the peak of manliness and is thus able to see virtue (ἀρετή). In turn, δακέθυμος
provides the model for Aeschylus’ δηξίθυμος, based on the s-aorist stem: in Ag.
743 it characterizes a pleasurable sensation, metaphorically described as the
‘flower of desire’ (ἔρωτος ἄνθος), brought to Troy by Helen. The same epithet
is found in a rather different context in a fragment describing a fine meal from
Sopater’s Physiologos (fr. 20 K-A), where it is paired with ὀξάλμη, a sauce made
with vinegar and brine.
     The only V2 compound with a regular formation, λαθροδήκτης, is difficult to
assess. The word is attested only once in Phrynichus’ Praeparatio sophistica 87.11
and apparently identifies a type of dog that jumps up at people and bites without
barking. Phrynichus condemns the word, preferring the expression λαίθαργος
κύων (cf. Aristoph. Eq. 1068), the starting point for his discussion.

               3 Competing pairs of V1 and V2 compounds: a contrastive analysis      297
     On balance, both the active use of compounds in -ής and the appearance
of θυμός in three out of the four Classical compounds derived from δάκνω iden-
tify this family as a mostly artificial one. The other V2 compound, λαθροδήκτης,
is also characteristic in that the FC provides and adverbial modification of the
verbal SC, rather than its argument. In MG both δάκνω and its compounds have
died out: the verb has been replaced by δαγκώνω and δαγκάνω, which do not
yield compounds.
δίκω
A neat chronological development is discernible in this family. The V1 pattern is
older, although not commonly found in appellatives: διώξιππος ‘driving horses’
is a common epithet in epinician poetry, but later dies out, surviving only as
a PN; διωξικέλευθος ‘urging on the way’ is almost a hapax, qualifying κέντρα
‘horse-goads’ in an epigram which has been attributed both to Philodemus (first
c. BC) and to Argentarius (fourth c. AD). The chronological precedence of the V1
pattern is further confirmed by the onomastic attestations, which are all from the
fifth c. BC onwards.
     V2 compounds, on the other hand, first appear in Theocritus, and on the
whole are infrequently attested. This may be connected to the fact that the agent
noun δίκτης is itself not attested before the New Testament and that the verb
does not possess other morphological means of creating agent nouns. δίκω is
preserved in MG in the form καταδιώκω, which does not yield any compounds.
ἔραμαι
This family of compounds exhibits another unusual distribution. The V1 pattern
is both older and overall more productive than the V2 pattern, although it
is mostly specialized in onomastics. The two appellative compounds which
display an unequivocal verb-argument structure—ἐρασίμολπος ‘loving song’
and ἐρασιχρήματος ‘loving money’—are both attested in the Classical age. This,
together with the chronology of the V2 compounds, is a strong indication that the
creation of a compound family from ἔραμαι was mostly a Classical accomplish-
ment. V2 compounds start with παιδεραστής ‘lover of boys’, attested in Aristo-
phanes, the source also of the first attestation of the agent noun ἐραστής. Seman-
tic overlap between the two types is limited to the pair  ̓Ερασίδημος (beginning of
the second century BC) and δημεραστής ‘friend of the people’ (Pl.). A few forms
in -εραστής are preserved in MG.
εὑρίσκω
This family of compounds has a low level of productivity. The V1 pattern is attested
earlier and tends to display a FC derived from the future stem εὑρησ- (εὑρησιεπής

evil’, attested in the scholia to Euripides’ Medea, the FC may be influenced by the
action noun εὕρεσις ‘discovery’ (Pl.). Both compounds find parallels in syntactic
phrases: see Isocr. In Call. 53 ἵνα μὴ μεταθεῖντο τὸ πρᾶγμα μηδ ̓ ἑτέρους λόγους
ἐξευρίσκοιεν ‘in order that they might not change their plans and invent another
story’ and Eur. Herc. 1177 ἀλλ ̓ ἄλλο πού τι καινὸν εὑρίσκω κακόν ‘some new evil
I discover here’.
     Since the simplex εὑρετής is a common form, attested as early as Plato, it is
not clear why V2 compounds are limited to πρωθευρετής ‘first discoverer’, found
in the second-century author Nicomachus of Gerasa, and clearly derived from
the phrase πρῶτος εὑρετής. Perhaps the low productivity of these compounds
is influenced by the fact that the agent noun does not seem to be used to refer
to someone engaged in a generic act of finding, but rather to a quite specific
person, the inventor of something: see for instance the Isocratean λόγων εὑρετής
‘prose-writer’ (Evag. 40), Plato’s οὔτε γὰρ εὑρετὴς οὔτε μαθητὴς οὐδενὸς περὶ τῶν
τοιούτων γεγονέναι (‘For [Socrates says] that he has never been either a discoverer
or a learner of any of these things’, La. 186e), or D.L. 9.25 φησὶ δ’ Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν
τῷ σοφιστῇ εὑρετὴν αὐτὸν γενέσθαι διαλεκτικῆς, ὥσπερ Ἐμπεδοκλέα ῥητορικῆς
(‘In the Sophist Aristotle says that he [Zeno] is the inventor of dialectic, just as
Empedocles [is the inventor] of rhetoric’).
     If this is the case, we are faced with a situation similar to the one described
in Class II: the agent noun has a low rate of compounding because of its semantic
specialization. This hypothesis is perhaps strengthened by the observation that
πρωθευρετής is not an argument-verb compound, but rather a specification of
εὑρετής.
θέλγω
The four V1 compounds in θελξι- are all poetic and cover the period between the
fifth century BC and the third century AD. Agentive V2 compounds are limited
to πανθέλκτειρα ‘all-charmer’ (Simon.). This low productivity may be connected
to the fact that the agent noun θελκτήρ has very few and late attestations (one
in the late Homeric Hymn to Asclepius and two in Nonnus). The only alternative
form, θέλκτωρ, is a hapax, conjectured by Musgrave at Aesch. Suppl. 1040 for the
vox nihili θεακτορι transmitted by codex M. The correction is a likely one in the
context of Suppl. 1040, where θέλκτωρ would be an epithet of Πειθώ, yielding the
meaning ‘Persuasion the charmer’.
     This lack of compounded agent nouns was not compensated for by the exist-
ence of other compound types: only two active compounds in -ής develop in Late
Antiquity (πανθελγής ‘charming all’, Nonn., and φρενοθελγής ‘charming the
heart’, Procl.). The low level of overall productivity is consistent with the the fact

that θέλγω, a common verb in early Greek texts, is not productive in later Greek,
where it remains mostly associated with epic poetry.
καλέω
V1 and V2 forms are both rare. V1 compounds are late and unproductive:
καλεσσίχορος ‘calling to the dance’ is a hapax. V2 formations are older and more
numerous, but it is important to note that ὁμοκλητήρ ‘shouter’ (Hom.) is in fact
the agent noun of the verb ὁμοκλάω (Hom. ὁμοκλέω ‘shout’), while ψευδοκλητήρ
‘one who falsely subscribes his name as witness to a summons’ (Theopomp.)
rather belongs to the category of determinative compounds, since the FC does not
function as an argument of the verb. This type is not preserved in MG.
κάμπτω
Both compound patterns are attested first in the fifth century BC. V1 compounds
are slightly more numerous, but they all seem to belong to literary language.
καμψίπους ‘bending the foot’, the epithet of the Erinys in Aeschylus Th. 791, is a
hapax of unclear meaning, as shown by the uncertainty of the scholia ad loc.: ἡ
κάμπτουσα τῶν κολαζομένων τοὺς πόδας καὶ συμποδίζουσα καὶ μὴ ἐῶσα φυγεῖν,
ἢ ἡ τοὺς ἑαυτῆς πόδας ἐπικλίνουσα καὶ πρὸς πάντας ἐπερχομένη (‘bending the
feet of those who are chased [by her], entangling the feet, not letting [them] run
away; or bending her own feet and attacking all’).
     This epithet finds a parallel in another hapax, attested in Hesychius in con-
nection with an Erinys: καμπεσίγουνος ‘bending the knees’, which may perhaps
represent a variant of the Aeschylean form. Another hapax, καμπεσίγυιος
‘bending the limbs’ qualifies παίγνια (to be understood as ‘games’, but the context
is not clear) in a fragment attributed to Orpheus by Clement of Alexandria and
Eusebius. The only non-poetic compound in this group may well be καμψίουρος
‘bending the tail’, which according to Hesychius is an alternative name for the
σκίουρος ‘squirrel’ (perhaps a scientific name?).
     A number of the V2 compounds too have an artificial character and reflect
the association of κάμπτω with musical contexts, in which connection the com-
pounds introduce a negative connotation.55 The hapax ᾀσματοκάμπτης ‘twister of
song’ is used by Aristophanes (Nu. 333) together with various other compounds
to identify the categories of intellectuals ‘fed’ by the Clouds. Similarly, Timo-
theus’ Ἰωνοκάμπτης ‘one who sings with soft Ionic modulations’ disparagingly
qualifies one of the poet’s rivals. In both Aristoph. Nu. 969–971 (εἰ δέ τις αὐτῶν
βωμολοχεύσαιτ’ ἢ κάμψειέν τινα καμπήν, οἵας οἱ νῦν, τὰς κατὰ Φρῦνιν ταύτας

with the citharode Phrynis.56 A third compound, πιτυοκάμπτης ‘pinebender’, is
used in various sources (starting with Strabo) as an epithet of Sinis, who killed
travellers by tying them to pinetrees. κάμπτω survives in MG, but yields no com-
pounds.
κινέω
The only V1 compound derived from this verb is the epithet κινησίγαιος, which
Heyschius uses to gloss the much more common epithet ἐννοσίγαιος ‘shaking the
earth’. The choice of this FC may have been prompted by the frequent use of agent
nouns derived from κινέω in reference to Poseidon and it is worth considering the
use of these agent nouns in context to corroborate this interpretation. κινητήρ is
attested only three times in Greek, and always as an epithet of the god. κινητής is
equally rare, and is used for the first time by Aristophanes in Nu. 1397 in reference
to Pheidippides, who is about to state his case:
     σὸν ἔργον, ͂ καινῶν ἐπῶν κινητὰ καὶ μοχλευτά,
     πειθώ τινα ζητεῖν, ὅπως δόξεις λέγειν δίκαια
     Your business, mover and upheaver of new words,
     Is to seek some means of persuasion, so that you shall seem to speak justly.
In his commentary on the Clouds, Dover (1968: 257–258) notes that μοχλευτής—
the other epithet referring to Pheidippides in these lines—occurs earlier in the
play as an epithet of Poseidon, who is imagined to cause earthquakes with a
lever: in the same way, κινητής here may allude to Poseidon’s traditional epithet.
The allusion perhaps draws attention to the fact that, just as Poseidon moves the
earth by invisible means, the techniques which Pheidippides will employ to move
words are obscure and impenetrable to the chorus. Given this background, we
can speculate that Hesychius’ gloss κινησίγαιος has its source in hymnic poetry
concerned with Poseidon.
     There are no attested V1 PNs derived from κινέω, but their existence is guar-
anteed by the Kurzname Κινησίας. V2 compounds too are limited to one specimen,
the late φωτοκινήτης ‘mover of light’, an epithet of the god Helios-Mithras invoked
in the magical papyrus containing the so-called ‘Mithras liturgy’ (PGM 4.599).57
This compound is one of a series of forms containing πῦρ or φῶς (see in par-

ticular φωτὸς κτίστα ‘light-maker’, πνευματόφως ‘light-breather, φωτοκράτωρ
‘light-master’, αὐξησίφως ‘light-increaser’): φωτοκινήτης belonged to an artifi-
cial, evocative language, and this explains the form’s rarity. Forms in -κινήτης are
attested in MG, but only with preverbs; modern forms in κινησιo- are not verbal
compounds, but compounds of κίνησις, e.g. κινησιοθεραπεία ‘cinesiotherapy’.
κοσμέω
This family is unproductive across all its categories. V1 compounds are limited
to only two PNs, both post-Classical. Κοσμησίστρατος has transparent semantics
(‘one who arranges the army’, see e.g. Hdt. 7.161.3 διακοσμῆσαι στρατόν: the use
of κοσμέω in a military sense is pervasive) and Κοσμησιάναξ could perhaps mean
‘he who adorns the lord’.
     The low productivity of V2 compounds could be linked to the fact that the
relevant agent nouns are mostly specialized. The contexts in which κοσμήτωρ
‘commander’ is usually found in Greek literature are restricted to epic poetry
and quotations of the common Homeric formula κοσμήτορε λαῶν ‘marshaller
of armies’. κοσμητής and κοσμητήρ have been transmitted to us mostly as the
names of magistrates at Athens and elsewhere, but in Hesychius κ 3766 κοσμητής·
κουρεύς. ἐνταφιαστής we also find evidence for a meaning connected to the idea
of ‘prepare, adorn’ conveyed by the verb in certain contexts: κουρεύς refers to a
kind of hairdresser, whereas ἐνταφιαστής suggests that a κοσμητής could also be
in charge of embalming dead bodies in preparation for burial. It is likely that this
meaning of κοσμητής arose in Koine Greek, since the two V2 compounds which
rely on it—χρυσοκοσμητής ‘decorator with gold’ (Vett. Val.) and τριχοκοσμητής
‘hairdresser’ (Hsch.), both referring to a type of κοσμητής specialized in adorning
certain things or using certain adorning techniques—are hapax legomena from a
late period. MG has preserved no compounds of this kind.
κρούω
In spite of the existence of the agent noun κρούστης and of the V2 compound
ζυγοκρούστης ‘one who uses a false balance’ (attested only twice), compounds
derived from this verb tend to be created according to the V1 pattern. The two
existing forms are rare, however. κρουσιλύρης ‘striking the lyre’ is a hapax,
one of the many epithets of the Κουρῆτες celebrated in the 38th Orphic hymn.
κρουσίθυρος, the name of a type of flute-song, is recorded in grammatical sources
(the attribution to Trypho comes from Athenaeus).
     Two other compounds in κρουσι-, κρουσιδημέω ‘cheat the people’ (Aristoph.)
and κρουσιμετρέω ‘cheat in measuring’ (Hsch.), retain the semantics of the action
noun κροῦσις in its meaning ‘attempt to deceive’, attested in Aristoph. Nu. 318. A

302          Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
similar meaning is to be understood in the case the V2 compound ζυγοκρούστης,
identifying one who cheats with his balance.
     The low productivity of V2 forms may be connected to the fact that the simple
agent noun κρούστης seems to have been very rare. It is attested only once, in
the fourth-century AD grammarian Dositheus, where it is glossed with petulcus,
a relatively rare Latin adjective mostly used to describe animals with a tendency
to butt.58 Semantic specialization is perhaps a further reason why the V1 pattern
was privileged in this case.
λαμβάνω
Surprisingly, considering the frequency of λαμβάνω in Greek, there are very few
compounds derived from this verb. The lack of V1 forms, with the PN Λαβίππᾱ
the sole representative, is all the more striking given that V2 compounds are
quite limited as well. Forms in -λήπτης are already attested in Classical Greek
(ἐργολήπτης ‘contractor’ in Teleclides, preserved in MG) but are unproduc-
tive: the other two forms are δωρολήπτης ‘greedy of gain’ (LXX), which is quite
common in Christian authors, and προσωπολήπτης ‘respecter of persons’ (NT).
This type survives in MG, with forms such as δανειολήπτης ‘someone who takes a
loan’ and αιμολήπτης ‘blood-receiver’. The simple agent noun λήπτης ‘catcher’ is
only attested in the late lexicon of Zonaras.
     Other types of active V2 compounds are similarly limited. Those in -λάβος
amount to three forms (this type persists in some MG words), while those in
-λαβής are limited to ὀξυλαβής ‘quick at seizing’ (said of the eagle in Aristot. HA)
and εὐλαβής which, in the meaning ‘devout’, continues to be used into MG.59
μιμνήσκω
Compounds derived from this verb display a clear preference for the V1 pattern,
which is used both in onomastics and in the appellative lexicon. This type
emerges very early in Greek, with the PN ma-na-si-we-ko, finding an alphabetic
Greek counterpart in Μνησίεργος ‘one who is mindful of work’. Some of the PNs
have perfectly clear semantics and it may be no chance that they are among the
most common names in Greek: see for instance Μνησίθεος ‘one who is mindful
58 The discussion in Dosith. 22.5 Bonnet is concerned with nominals which share characteris-
tics with participles. The Latin forms quoted by Dositheus to explain the Greek ones, however,
are all characterized by suffixes like -bundus and -ulcus, which are typical of verbal adjectives
(Bonnet 2005: 135). The discussion therefore seems really to be concerned with Greek verbal
derivations which acquire a quasi-adjectival meaning, and this may add further support to the
hypothesis that κρούστης had acquired a specialized meaning.

who is mindful of the army’.60
     Appellatives are productive only until the end of the Classical age, after which
no new forms are coined. As far as productivity is concerned, the most common
compound is μνησίκακος ‘one who remembers injuries, revengeful’, together with
the typical verb of Attic oaths and treaties μνησικακέω (usually preceded by a nega-
tion: ‘I shall not be revengeful ...’); both μνησιπήμων and μνᾱσιστέφανος are hapax
legomena (μνησιπήμων also receives comment in the scholia to Aeschylus).
     As noted in section 2.1.5, V2 compounds are based on the noun μνήμων. With
the exception of ἱερομνήμων, a form often found in prose texts, these compounds
in -μνήμων are not very common. The impression one gains is that μιμνήσκω
ceased to be a productive source of compounds already in the Classical age.
ὄλλυμι
The sum total of both V1 and V2 compounds is relatively small, and is confined
(unsurprisingly, given the meaning of the verb) to appellative forms. V1 com-
pounds all derive from the aorist stem, which may be altered into the artificial
FCs ὠλεσι- or ὀλεσσι- for metrical purposes. Of these forms, only ὠλεσίκαρπος
‘losing its fruits’ (Hom.) enjoys some popularity in later sources: all the remaining
compounds are rare.
     Each of the three agent nouns derived from the verb features in V2 com-
pounds. Of these, formations in -τηρ and -τωρ are generally rare: ἀνδρολέτειρα
‘murderess’ is found in Aeschylus and in a lyric adespoton, παιδολέτειρα and
παιδολέτωρ (both ‘child-murdering’) are used only by Euripides and later by
Nonnus, πατρολέτωρ ‘parricide’ is a hapax, and Γιγαντολέτωρ ‘giant-killer’ is
mostly quoted in order to be contrasted with the more recent form Γιγαντολέτης.
The forms in -της are from later periods and never display high productivity; they
are not preserved in MG, where ὄλλυμι has been lost.
ὄρνυμι
This is a special case in that V1 pattern, which has its first attestations in Myce-
naean and Homeric Greek (see Chapter 4, sections 7.2 and 8.1), is the only prolific
one. This seems to be due to the fact that there are no simple agent nouns derived
from ὄρνυμι. Moreover, the connection with the two V2 compounds etymologi-
cally linked to this verb, Λαέρτᾱς and Λυκόρτᾱς, was probably obscure to speak-
ers, because of the different vowel diplayed in the SC.61

     The appellative V1 compounds seem to have been highly poetic formations.
They are all hapax legomena (or poetic forms later quoted only in lexicography),
with the exception of the accusative ὀρσιγυναίκα, epithet of Dionysos, which has
four attestations because it belongs to a lyric adespoton quoted in three different
works of Plutarch. Semantic overlap between V2 and V1 forms can be observed
only in  ̓Ορσέλᾱος vs. Λαέρτᾱς. ὄρνυμι does not survive into MG.
π́ρθω
The only two compounds derived from this verb are the mirror image of one another
and betray a certain degree of artificiality: περσέπτολις (Hes.) and πτολ́πορθος
(Hom.). Both mean ‘destroying cities’ and enjoy a similar level of popularity in
the poetic register, above all hexametric poetry. The FC in πτολ́πορθος always
appears in its Homeric shape: the more common πολι- is never attested in this
compound. The sparsity of compounds could be linked to the fact that the base
verb is a poetic formation and rarely used in prose.
     This is a convenient place for a note on the name Περσεφόνεια, which already
in antiquity was etymologized as deriving from πέρθω. With very few exceptions,
this etymology is now rejected.62 Both the association of the FC with πέρθω and of
the SC with θείνω (> -φονος) yield no meaningful sense, and it is now recognized
that the original shape of the SC was -φαττα. Janda (2000: 224–250) provides an
excellent overview of the alternative etymologies which have been proposed. His
suggestion is that the FC originally derived from *per- ‘bring back’ and that the SC
is connected to the same root which yields Greek φῶς ‘light’: Persephone would
thus be ‘she who brings back light’.63 On the other hand, Wachter (2006: 139–144)
and (2007–2008) proposes etymologizing the name as a compound of *persó-
‘leek’ and *gwhen- ‘hit’. He interprets Persephone as ‘the threshing maiden’,
someone who helps to beat the sheaves: an appropriate name for the daughter of
the goddess of crops.
πήγνυμι
The first attested compound derived from this verb is the Homeric epithet
πηγεσίμαλλος, whose FC, however, does not have a governing function (‘com-
pressing fleece’) but rather works as an adjective: ‘having thick, compressed
fleece’.64 πηγεσίμαλλος, as suggested by Knecht (1946: 29), probably serves as
a substitute for *πηγόμαλλος (< πηγός ‘solid’), whose cretic shape prevents its

inclusion in the hexameter. The only other compound is the apparent epithet
πηξιθάλαττα ‘she that freezes the sea’, transmitted by the lexicographer Phryni-
chus and edited as the comic adespoton 655 K-A; its FC is formed with the stem of
the sigmatic tensese of πήγνυμι. It is not really possible to speak of ‘competition’
between the V1 and V2 compounds: the only productive pattern of active com-
pounds are those in -πηγός, which emerge in Homer and continue in post-Clas-
sical Greek. Probably under the influence of these compounds in -πηγός, the old
passive type in -παγής develops a few late active forms: γυιοπαγής ‘stiffening the
limbs’ (Antip.), ἰχθυπαγής ‘piercing fish’ (Theaet.) and ναυπηγής ‘ship-building’
(Man.).
πλήσσω
The compounds derived from this verb amount to a mere four forms. The two
older forms are both compounded with words indicating animals: πλήξιππος
‘striking horses, inciting horses’ is a common epithet of heroes in poetry and as
such is also used as a PN; βουπλήξ, one of the few root compounds to hold their
ground in Greek, identifies the ox-goad or an axe for felling an ox.
     The third item, Hesychius’ hapax ἰσχυροπλήκτης ‘wounding severely’, cor-
responds to the agent noun πλήκτης ‘striker’: its FC expresses a modification
of the head and the structure is very close to that of determinative compounds.
ἰσχυροπλήκτης is the interpretamentum of another form in -πλήκτης, διοπλήκτᾱν
(δ 1897): its [a:] and accusative ending suggest that it was taken from a poetic text
in Doric or Aeolic. Its meaning (not glossed in LSJ) may be similar to that exem-
plified in certain passive compounds derived from πλήσσω which are attested in
late sources and compounded with θεός: θεοπλήξ (Hsch.) and θεόπλᾱκτος, both
meaning ‘stricken by god’: perhaps it meant ‘one who strikes the gods’ (and thus
‘wounding severely’?). Active compounds in -πληγής (e.g. φρενοπληγής ‘striking
the mind’, Aesch.) are sporadic.
     While the lack of other active forms in -πλήξ is probably due to the fact that
root compounds were a moribund type already in Archaic Greek, it is open to
speculation why V1 compounds in πληξι- did not continue into Classical Greek.
Part of the reason is perhaps discernible in the fact that the active voice of πλήσσω
is very much confined to early Greek. LSJ s.v. notes that the present is not used by
Attic authors, who prefer the synonyms πάω and τύπτω; an entry on πλήσσω is
altogether lacking in Sophocles (1914).
πράσσω
The group of compounds derived from πράσσω belongs among the less produc-

display meaningful combinations of constituents, for instance Πραξιτέλης ‘one
who achieves his goal’ or ‘one who exacts taxes’ and Πραξιδίκη ‘she who exacts
penalties’. However, the popularity of these names was no doubt reinforced by
the frequency of the action noun πρᾶξις, which had a wide range of applications
and was particularly common in the language of commerce.
     The low number of compounded agent nouns (amounting to the hapax legom-
ena παντοπράκτης ‘ready to do anything’ and the dubious λογοπράκτωρ) may be
connected to the nature of the relevant agent nouns. πρηκτήρ and πρακτήρ are
mostly used by authors who quote Homer’s line μύθων τε ῥητῆρ’ ἔμεναι πρηκτῆρά
τε ἔργων ‘to be a speaker of words and a doer of things’ (Il. 9.443). Their status
as rare words which, it may have been felt, needed to be actively preserved in
learned Greek is confirmed by the fact that Pollux twice quotes πρακτήρ in his
Onomasticon (5.103 and 8.114), at one point while informing his readers that it
was used as the name of an official. πράκτωρ, attested down to Late Antiquity,
oscillates between the general meaning ‘doer’ (as in its first attestation in Soph.
Tr. 251), which is more long-lived, and the specialized meaning ‘official who exe-
cutes a judgment for debt’, attested in Attic orators and inscriptions and recalled
by Pollux 114 πράκτης in the general meaning of ‘doer’ is found exclusively in
lexicographical sources, but in its Ionic form πρήκτης is perhaps attested in the
Hippocratic Epistulae with the meaning ‘treacherous person’ (see too Hesychius’
interpretamentum of πράκτης as τολμητής ‘bold person’).65
     The sparsity of the agentive type seems to have encouraged the late devel-
opment of a small group of active compounds in -πρᾱγής, starting in the second
c. AD (δυσπρᾱγής ‘faring ill’, Vett. Val.); for their analysis, see section 4. In MG
πράσσω has been lost and the only V2 compound is the Neoclassical formation
χειροπράκτης ‘chiropractor’.
ῥάπτω
This is another case where competition between V1 and V2 forms is lacking. V1
compounds derived from ῥάπτω are all appellative and amount to ῥαψωδός and
its derivations: they obviously have many attestations in Greek, but the com-
pound type itself is not productive. The predominance of V2 forms is evident
from the fact that there are three separate subgroups: one in -ρραφος, which
starts with μηχανορράφος, literally ‘stitching together crafty plans’ (Soph.); a
less common one in -ρράπτης, which corresponds to the rare agent noun ῥάπτης
65 The nominative plural πρῆκται is read in most of the manuscripts transmitting the shorter
version of Hippocrates’ 19th epistle (l. 8), whereas codex D (followed in Littré’s edition) reads
πλῆκται. πρήκτης is also read twice in the longer version of the epistle (section 43) transmitted
by Cod. Urbinas 68: see Diels (1918: 67, 76).

‘clothes-mender’ (Philox.); and a mostly passive one in -ρραφής, which includes
two active forms (see section 4.2.2).
     ράβω is the standard form of the verb in MG, while ράπτω is a very high-sound-
ing archaic word and the same applies to its compounds ελληνοράφτης ‘tailor
who makes traditional Greek clothes’ and φραγκοράφτης ‘tailor who makes
Western-style clothes’. Compounds in -ράφτης have therefore ceased to be pro-
ductive because of pragmatics.66
σείω
With compounds derived from this verb we witness the opposite state of affairs
to that just described in respect of ῥάπτω: only the V1 type has some level of pro-
ductivity, whereas V2 compounds would be altogether lacking (thus making σείω
a member of Group II) were it not for the late attestation of πυργοσείστης ‘tow-
er-shaker’, the name of a war engine, found in the anonymous lexicon Περὶ τῶν
τεσσάρων μερῶν τοῦ τελείου λόγου. Its other occurrences are in the twelfth-cen-
tury author Constantinus Manasses, a fact which suggests that the compound
was probably coined in Medieval Greek. As noted in section 2.1.4, the simple
agent noun σειστής is a late-antique form identifying a kind of earthquake.
     V1 compounds, although amounting to four forms, are widely distributed.
σεισίχθων ‘shaking the earth’ (Pi.) is one of Poseidon’s traditional epithets and
enjoys continuous popularity in poetry and beyond. σεισάχθεια, the name of
Solon’s measures for the relief of private and public debt, has the status of a tech-
nical term and is often quoted in the context of Athenian political discourse. The
PNs Σεισίλοχος ‘Shakespeare’ and Σείσιππος ‘one who shakes horses’ may have
their origin in a military context, though clear parallels are not attested.
στέλλω
This is another compound family where only one of the two types is a productive
means of word formation, and this time it is the existence of the PN Στελλανδρίδης
side by side with V2 compounds which places the family as a whole in Group
IV. The meaning of this PN may reflect the phrase attested in Il. 4.294 ἑτάρους
στέλλοντα καὶ ὀτρύνοντα μάχεσθαι ‘preparing his comrades and urging them to
fight’.67 The common compounds derived from στέλλω are those in -στολος. As
noted in the Corpus, many can still be seen to betray their bahuvrihi origin, but
some of the later forms have a clearer agentive structure (e.g. νεκυοστόλος ‘ferry-
ing the dead’, Antip. Thess.). This agentive type, however, is generally late.
66 Io Manolessou, p.c.
67 The gloss Hsch. σ 1725 στελλάνδρα· ἡ κόρη probably represents a relic from a text in which
Στελλάνδρα was a girl’s name, so that the interpretamentum would simply be referring to this.

308           Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
τελέω
Compounds derived from this verb are included among the less common families,
despite the popularity of the V1 PNs, due to the lack of V1 appellatives and the
fact that there is only one V2 compound, βουτελέστης, glossed with θύτης ‘sacrif-
icer’ in Hesychius. To begin with this last form, we should note that it is not clear
whether the SC -τελέστης simply conveys the verbal idea of ‘to finish off, to kill’,
so that the compound indicates any person performing a sacrifice; or whether the
FC acquires the specialization evidenced by many attestations of the simple agent
nouns τελέστης and τελετής ‘priest, initiator’, so that the compound refers to a
particular kind of priest connected with the Eleusinian mysteries. As noted in the
Corpus, τελέω does not even develop a productive type of active compounds in
-τελής: the only form which can be interpreted as such is καρποτελής ‘bringing
fruit to perfection’, attested in Aeschylus.
      PNs are quite common, as already mentioned, to a large extent because the
availability of two different FCs allows the duplication of certain patterns (these
have been noted in the Corpus whenever possible). The database in the LGPN
registers ninety forms beginning with Τελε-: of these, thirty-two have the FC
Τελεσι- (in both cases the final number includes various Kurznamen and com-
pounds which are not listed in the Corpus).68 Given the semantic range of τελέω
and the lack of appellatives, whose meaning we could expect to be transparent,
it is not easy to interpret the semantics of these names. In certain cases the stems
Τελε- or Τελεσι- may allude to the Eleusinian mysteries, which gained popularity
at the end of the fifth century BC, the precise period in which most of these PNs
begin to appear.69 However, the assortment of SCs displayed by these names is
closely similar to what we find in the case of other common V1 families of PNs, so
that even if a mysteric allusion were contained in some of these forms, it would
be confined to the FC only and not concern the meaning of the whole compound.
τέμνω
In this case it is not possible to speak of genuine ‘competition’, as the V1 type is
attested only once in the Homeric adjective ταμεσίχρως ‘cutting the skin’, whose
FC is, from a synchronic point of view, based on the stem of the thematic aorist

ἔταμον.70 This compound is found in other, mostly poetic, texts down to Nonnus,
who makes great use of it.
      V2 compounds in -τομος, on the other hand, constitute one of the most pro-
ductive categories of V2 compounds in Greek. They go back to Mycenaean, which
has two occupational terms ending in -tomos, and are used both as adjectives and
as nouns. Nouns indicating professions are particularly common and some are
still preserved in MG (e.g. υλοτόμος ‘tree-feller’), where τέμνω ‘cut, pass through’
is also used.71
τιμάω
This is a compound family in which only the V1 pattern is productive, though it is
attested solely in onomastics. PNs display the FC Τιμησι-, based on the sigmatic
tenses; a number of compounds in Τιμο- and Τιμα- may also have a verbal origin
and have been included in the Corpus. Among the potentially meaningful PNs,
see Τιμησαρέτη ‘one who values virtue’, Τιμησίδικος ‘one who values justice’ and
Τιμησίθεος ‘one who honours the gods’.
      The fact that V2 compounds amount to a single form can be ascribed to two
factors. The first is the specialization of the two nomina agentis τιμητής and
τιμητήρ, which both indicate officials who were in charge of assessing proper-
ties or taxes. The late compound στιπποτιμητής ‘tow-valuer’ (fourth century BC)
retains this meaning and represents a specialization of τιμητής.
      The second factor is the existence of compounds in -τιμος which started off as
bahuvrihis containing τιμή ‘value’ (e.g. ἄτιμος ‘dishonoured’ or βούτιμος ‘worth
an ox’) but soon acquired the semantics of verbal compounds: see e.g. ξενότιμος
‘honouring strangers’ (Aesch.). This type follows the same development as other
nominal compounds which acquire the semantics of the associated denomina-
tive verb (type ἀνάσσω : ἄναξ); these compounds will be analysed in section 5.
However, compounds in -τιμος that have a clear active meaning and cannot be
interpreted as bahuvrihis are not common: the type remains marginal.
70 According to some scholars, ταμ- was the original stem of the present, later replaced in most
of Greek by a new e-grade stem based on the old root aorist: for this view, see Wackernagel (1916:
14), Forssman (1966), DEG s.v. τέμνω. Beekes (1969 : 222), by contrast, considers τεμ- the regular
phonetic outcome of the zero-grade thematic aorist, later replaced by the analogical ἔταμον.
Contra, see Harđarson (1993: 161), according to whom τάμνω is analogical on ἔταμον; he is now
followed by Beekes in EDG.

310         Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
τλῆναι
Compounds derived from the root which produces the root aorist τλῆναι and, sec-
ondarily, the present ταλάω are included in this group because they represent a
mostly poetic and not particularly productive category, and this despite the fact
that a relatively high number of different formations contribute to their creation.
As noted in the Corpus, the abundance of FCs (τλη-, ταλα-, ταλαι-, τλησι-) can
be explained with reference to the interference of other morphological patterns,
particularly adjectives in the case of ταλα- (τάλας) and ταλαι- (τάλαινα).
     In general, the whole compound family seems to have been chracterized by
a high degree of artificiality: the FC τλησι- is the only one whose shape can be
explained according to one of the productive V1 patterns, although there is no
sigmatic verbal form to which it can be connected. τλη- does not end with any
linking element but employs the bare root and this, as tentatively suggested in
Chapter 4, section 3, may even be considered the original state of affairs for com-
pounds based on bare roots.
     V2 compounds derived from τλῆναι are not formed with the suffixes -της, -τηρ
and -τωρ. Verbal semantics is conveyed by the compounds of τλήμων ‘patient’ (<
‘bearing’) and τάλας ‘wretched’ (< ‘suffering’), as well as by Ἄτλας and πολύτλας.
However, the fact that none of these forms is compounded with a substantival
FC calls into question their status as verbal compounds: forms in -τλήμων and
-τάλας could also be interpreted as adjectival determinative compounds (which
tend to display adverbial or adjectival FCs: see Chapter 2, section 4.6), while the
two forms in -τλας comply with the formation patterns of compounded partici-
ples, which mostly employ prepositional and adverbial FCs (substantival FCs are
really limited to PNs: see Chapter 2, section 6.6).72
τρέφω
This is another compound family in which the V2 orientation is ancient and
clearly predominant. The earliest form is κουροτρόφος ‘rearing children’, a
common epithet of lands and cities, which we have often used for illustrative pur-
poses when discussing the category of active V2 CoC-os compounds. In this case,
the existence of the agent noun τροφός ‘nurse’ may have been a factor in making
the type productive at all chronological stages. τρέφω, τροφός and compounds
in τρόφος survive into MG.
     Rather surprisingly, given the semantics of the verb, V1 forms are limited
to the PN Τρεφέλεως, the mirror image of λαοτρόφος ‘nourishing the people’
attested in Pindar. Here, then, the popularity of the V2 pattern forestalled the
development of the other type.

                 3 Competing pairs of V1 and V2 compounds: a contrastive analysis              311
τρέχω
Because of the intransitive semantics of this verb, it is not common to find
compounds of either the V1 or V2 type in which the other compound constitu-
ent functions as an argument of the verbal constituent. Only the V1 compound
τρεχέδειπνος ‘running to dinner’ (Posidipp.) has such a structure. This com-
pound, used to describe the attitude of the typical parasite who is ready to accept
any invitation to dinner, has a good number of attestations in post-Classical texts.
     V2 compounds derived either from τρέχω or the suppletive root δραμ-/δρομ-
in which the FC is a noun are rare. Again, this is probably the result of the intran-
sitive semantics of the verb. Among the forms with a substantival FC collected in
the Corpus, ἁλίτροχος ‘running through the sea’, attributed to Ibycus, is in fact
only discussed in grammatical sources in connection with its declension pattern;
αἰθεροδρόμος ‘ether-skimming’ is not used in AG after its first attestation in
Aristophanes and only resurfaces in late Byzantine authors; only δολιχοδρόμος
‘running the δόλιχος (long race)’ is a frequent form in Classical Greek. In MG,
some forms in -δρόμος have active verbal semantics, e.g. πεζόδρομος ‘walker’,
but in most cases their SC is the noun δρόμος ‘route’.
φεύγω
This compound family is peculiar in many respects. V1 compounds are by far the
most common, given that the V2 pattern is limited to the late ὀψίφυγος ‘fleeing
late’.73 Apart from two onomastic specimina (Φυγοστρατίδης and Φευγόλιμος),
both semantically transparent, all V1 compounds are appellatives. In most cases
the FC is derived from the aorist stem φυγ- and followed by the linking vowel -o-
rather than by the common -ε-.74 The full-grade root (used to form the thematic
radical present) is attested only in the late φεύγυδρος ‘shunning water’ (Polybos)
and in Φευγόλιμος (fourth c. BC). In a few other forms -σι- is artificially attached
to this aorist stem, e.g. φυξίμηλον (Aesch.), φυξήλιος (Nic.), and φυξίπολις
(Opp.). These rarer FCs, which no doubt are also influenced by the action noun
φύξις ‘flight, refuge’, have disappeared already in Byzantine Greek; the only FC
preserved in MG is φυγο-.75
73 Technical terms such as the Italian ignifugo ‘fire-resistant’ are Neoclassical formations that
have no basis in either AG or Classical Latin. In MG, only κεντρόφυγος ‘centrifugal’ is attested.
74 On the hypothesis that this linking vowel is analogical on substantival FCs, see Chapter 4,
section 3.1.
75 See the common φυγοδικία ‘default’, φυγόκεντρος ‘centrifugal’, φυγομαχία ‘avoiding a fight’

‘draft dodger’.

312          Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
     The productivity of the individual forms collected in the Corpus is not high,
however. φυγοπτόλεμος ‘escaping war’ remains a Homeric adjective (it is later
found in Herodian and Quintus Smyrnaeus); attestations of φυγόμαχος ‘escap-
ing battle’ end with Stobaeus; φυγόξενος ‘shunning strangers’ is a Pindaric
hapax (later only found in the scholia); φυξίμηλον ‘avoiding cattle’ is a rare form
attributed to Aeschylus and discussed also by Plutarch; φυξανορία ‘aversion to
men’, perhaps to be read in Aesch. Supp. 8, is a hapax; φυγαίχμης ‘fleeing from
the spear’ is a learned term, after Aeschylus used by Callimachus and discussed in
lexicographical sources; after appearing in Demosthenes, φυγοδικέω ‘shirk a trial’
is discussed by Pollux and surfaces again only in late-antique authors; φυξήλιος
‘shunning the sun’ is found only in Nicander, Porphyrius and Hesychius. The
later Greek forms φυγόπονος ‘shunning work’, φυξίπολις ‘fleeing the city’ and
φυγόλεκτρος ‘shunning the marriage-bed’ are all hapax legomena in AG (they
may be discussed in the scholia or resurface in later Byzantine authors, but are
generally unproductive). The V1 pattern thus emerges as a poetic or learned type
in AG: it is only thanks to the preserving influence of linguistic purism that forms
such as φυγοδικία or φυγόστρατος survive in MG.
φθείρω
In this family the V2 orientation is the more common: it emerges in Theognis
and remains productive well into Byzantine times, as is testified by forms such
as θανατοφθόρος ‘destroying death’, used by the patriarch Germanus I, or
φλογοφθόρος ‘estinguishing fire’, attested in the twelfth-century author Nicetas
Eugenianus. φθείρω is still used in MG, but its phonology (with the cluster φθ
being preserved and not turned into φτ, as is normally the case in standard
language) betrays its learned status. Its compounds are not numerous, with
ψυχοφθόρος [mind destroy] ‘harrowing, extremely distressing’ the only common
form. The only ancient V1 compound, φθερσιγενής ‘destroying the race’, is almost
a hapax, only found in the scholia outside its first attestation in Aeschylus. It is
not clear why φθείρω creates no onomastic compounds.
φράζω
In this family V1 compounds are associated with onomastics. PNs in φρασι- emerge
at the end of the sixth century BC with Φρασίκλεια; it is hard to attribute precise
semantics to most of these onomastic forms (could Φρασίδημος mean ‘one who
speaks to/among the people’?). The low productivity of this verb in compounding
is also demonstrated by the lack of V2 compounds, which only seem to appear for
the first time with Agathias’ learned σκινδαλαμοφράστης, indicating a person who
splits hairs over something. φράζω survives into MG, where, however, the only
forms in -φραστής are preverbed agent nouns (e.g. μεταφραστής ‘translator’).

                3 Competing pairs of V1 and V2 compounds: a contrastive analysis       313
φύω
Overall, φύω is not as common a verb in compounding as its meaning would
perhaps lead one to expect. The V1 pattern, although already used in Homeric
Greek (φυσίζοος ‘producing life’), is later not exploited at all. V2 compounds are
also rare and their lack of productivity is shown by the fact that in πτεροφύτωρ
‘feather-producing’ (Pl.) and ἀμπελοφύτωρ ‘wine-planter’ (Leon.) the SC keeps
the -τωρ suffix. The competing -ής type (e.g. πτεροφυής ‘growing feathers or
wings’, Pl.) also never becomes a common pattern.
3.2.1 Summary of characteristics
The forty-one compound families analysed above have been included in this
subgroup either because one of the two patterns is unproductive, or because
attestations of both types are low. The first trend that we can observe is that V1
compounds are predominantly onomastic, while V2 forms are predominantly
appellative. This trend is so predictable that it might well serve as a rule. The fam-
ilies in which a clear subdivision is particularly evident are those derived from
ἀρτύω, δίκω, ἔραμαι, κοσμέω, λαμβάνω, μιμν́σκω, πράσσω, τελέω, τιμάω,
τρέφω and φράζω. This distribution agrees with what was observed for some of
the seventeen families of the first group (see section 3.1.1).
     In general, however, individual types of V2 compounds are not very numer-
ous. The only productive types are those derived from βόσκω, πήγνυμι, ῥάπτω,
στέλλω, τέμνω, τρέφω and φθείρω: note that, βόσκω aside, these are all V2
compounds with SCs ending in -ος. This confirms that the V2 pattern is not
the predominant type by default, but tends to be so only in association with a
well-defined morphological structure. In contrast to these common V2 forms, the
corresponding V1 compounds show a clear tendency to be rare, highly poetic or
artificial (see βωτιάνειρα, πηγεσίμαλλος, ταμεσίχρως, φθερσιγενής), limited to
one item (ῥαψωδός), or specialized as PNs (see στέλλω, τρέφω).
     The remaining V2 types prove to be mostly rare forms. Some are associ-
ated with markedly poetic language: see those derived from ἀγείρω, κάμπτω,
μιμνήσκω, ὄλλυμι, πέρθω, πλήσσω, τλῆναι, τρέχω and φύω. Of these, only V2
compounds derived from πέρθω and τρέχω are compounds of the CoC-os type.
Others have late first attestations and tend to remain isolated: see the compounds
derived from γιγνώσκω, δάκνω, εὑρίσκω, κινέω, κοσμέω, κρούω, λαμβάνω,
πράσσω, σείω, τελέω, τιμάω, φεύγω and φράζω. These are all forms in -της,
except for those derived from φεύγω. V2 compounds derived from ἀραρίσκω are
unproductive because of their morphological opacity, while those derived from
ἀκούω and καλέω are semantic specializations of the simplicia (thus, a kind of
determinative compound) and remain rare. This perhaps adds further support to

what we observed in section 2.2, namely that V1 compounds may provide stronger
competition to V2 compounds in -της, since these tend to develop later and more
slowly than V2 compounds in -ος. Another factor which probably comes into play
is the fact that -της compounds are exclusively nouns, while V1 compounds are
prototypically adjectives and hence afford a higher grammatical flexibility.
      If we now focus on the V1 compounds corresponding to the rare V2 com-
pounds we have just reviewed, it emerges that the forms which, to an extent,
fill in for unproductive V2 compounds are those derived from εὑρίσκω, θέλγω,
μιμνήσκω, σείω and φεύγω. In all other cases, we are faced with isolated V1
formations corresponding to isolated V2 formations. These include compounds
derived from ἀραρίσκω, καλέω, κινέω, κρούω, πέρθω, πήγνυμι, τλῆναι, τρέχω
and φύω. There also is a high number of typically poetic forms (see the V1 com-
pounds derived from δάκνω, κάμπτω, ὄλλυμι, ὄρνυμι and τελέω), while others
are clearly artificial (see under ἀγείρω, ἀκούω and πήγνυμι).
      Let us now summarize these results. The low productivity of the compounds
in these families was of course to be expected, since that was the criterion on the
basis of which they were assigned to this subgroup. It is rather more surprising to
discover that in parallel with rare V1 compounds we generally also find rare V2
compounds. This means that productivity cannot be assessed solely on the basis
of theoretical models (such as one which predicts that Greek will always prefer
the V2 orientation), but must be tested against a comprehensive study of all attes-
tations. When this is carried out in earnest, it becomes evident that the behaviour
of compounds is very often related to the productivity of the relevant verb, its use
in a certain type of text (e.g. κάμπτω in musical terminology) or chronological
period (e.g. compounds in -κοσμητής), and semantic restrictions (as noted e.g.
for καλέω and τρέχω, or for the agent nouns derived from πράσσω). What the
analysis in this section has contributed, therefore, is a new method of approach
that can help to correct the simplistic view of V1 compounds as an exclusively
marginal type in contrast to the invariably productive V2 type.
4 V1 compounds and deverbative compounds in -́ς
So far we have mostly focused on the interaction of V1 compounds with V2 com-
pounds in -ος, -της, -τηρ and -τωρ: these are the most productive categories of
active verbal compounds and often represent exact counterparts of V1 forms. In
passing, we have also noted the development of a few active compounds in -ής (see
δάκνω, ῥάπτω, λαμβ́νω). In all these cases, the active compounds do not provide
productive counterparts to V1 compounds or other types of V2 formations, but
mostly add a later and usually uncommon alternative (also see section 4.2.2).

     There exists, however, a group of seventeen verbs for which active -ής com-
pounds are the only productive V2 pattern, and the creation of these compounds
must be investigated, first, in view of the general development of verbal -́ς com-
pounds in Greek and, secondly, by taking into consideration the behaviour of the
base verbs with respect to the creation of agent nouns and V1 compounds. Since
deverbative compounds in -́ς seem originally to have been limited to the expres-
sion of passive or stative-intransitive semantics, we will first review the initial
development of this type in order to see how the earlier passive examples opened
the way for the later growth of active formations. This background knowledge will
prove useful when it comes to assessing the role of the new -́ς active compounds
within the system of verbal compounds, and particularly their interaction with
V1 compounds.
4.1 Verbal -́ς compounds: a brief history
The early development of verbal -́ς compounds in Greek has recently been
studied by Meissner (2006) from a comparative point of view. While non-verbal
compounds in -́ς originate as adjectives derived from neuter stems in *-es/-os
(e.g. δυσμεν́ς ‘evil-minded’ from μένος ‘mind’) and have parallels in other IE
languages, those derived from verbal stems are an exclusively Greek innovation
(see too Chapter 2, section 6.2).76 The hypothesis that these verbal compounds too
derive from neuter nouns is an inconvenient one, since, as more than one scholar
has pointed out, it forces linguists to reconstruct a large number of unattested
nouns.77
     While in the past these verbal compounds were considered to be exceptions
to the so-called ‘Caland system’, scholars are now more open to the idea that they
may have originated within that system, despite later developing independently.
Risch (1974: 81) suggested that the trigger was the semantic reanalysis of a few
‘Caland’ bahuvrihis into verbal compounds (e.g. διογεν́ς ‘having divine origin’
> ἐκ Διὸς γενέσθαι > ‘born from Zeus’), which eventually led to new forms being
created in the absence of an already existing bahuvrihi.
     However, this semantic factor, while certainly at play, was probably not
enough to initiate a linguistic phenomenon of such large proportions. Other
factors, of a morpho-phonological kind, must also have played a role. A large
number of early forms correspond to passive aorists in -η- (e.g. ἀαγ́ς ‘unbro-
ken’ : ἔγην ‘I am broken’), and at times also to sigmatic aorists in -ησ- (which in

Greek often take the place of old statives in *-ē- < *-eh1-),78 as well as a few perfect
stems containing -η-.79 Attempts have been made to connect this stative suffix to
the Caland system:80 this would have the consequence of situating the origin of
deverbal -́ς compounds in an earlier period than previously thought.
     In early Greek there is a clear morphological and semantic correlation
between -́ς compounds and passive or intransitive aorists in -η-, which may well
have constituted the original core of the category. However, in Mycenaean and
Homeric Greek some -ής compounds are derived from other verbal formations
as well, a fact which shows that the derivational process must have been per-
turbed already at an early stage. The Mycenaean two-word sequence ke-re-si-jo
we-ke is likely to represent the compound /krēsio-wergēs/ ‘Cretan-made’: this
would therefore derive from the e-grade of the root *werg-, a root which otherwise
creates passive and active compounds derived from the o-grade (see the analysis
in section 3.1 above).
     A similar case is represented by verbal compounds derived from τρέφω: side
by side with the numerous active and passive compounds in CoC-ος (κουροτρόφος
and ὀρεσίτροφος) and the passive compounds in -τραφής, an alternative passive
type in -τρεφής is found already in Homeric Greek (Διοτρεφής ‘fostered by Zeus’).
This is later followed by a handful of active compounds (e.g. μυελοτρεφής ‘breed-
ing marrow’, Timoth.). In this case, the compounds are neither based on the
passive aorist (ἐτράφην) nor on an aorist in -ησ-: they simply develop on the basis
of analogy. Since these active compounds are already attested in Homer, where
there are other passive compounds in -τρεφής, the influence of the analogy must
have come into effect early on.81
     Another derivational path links -έω verbs to compounds in -ής. φιλέω is a
good example: there is no neuter noun in -οσ-/-εσ-, but s-stem compounds in
-φιλής are nevertheless attested, and this shows that they must derive directly
from the denominative. These compounds are mostly passive (e.g. δυσφιλής
‘hard to love’ and εὐφιλής ‘well-loved’, both Aesch.), but active forms are also
attested: see γυναικοφιλής ‘woman-loving’ in Polyzelus and μουσοφιλής ‘lover of
the Muses’ in Philodemus.
     Early forms in -ής are therefore mostly passive, but in the course of its chron-
ological development the category assumes a variety of functions, and in the
large semantic spectrum which it covers the categories of passivity and, more

importantly, intransitivity play a fundamental role.82 This semantic speciali-
zation explains why the type in -ής quickly gained immense productivity, as it
conveniently filled several gaps in the system of Greek verbal compounds. Greek
had inherited only one type of passive verbal compound from PIE, that of com-
pounded verbal adjectives in *-tos. As we have seen (Chapter 2, section 6.7), this
type was already quite productive in Mycenaean and early Greek, but, crucially,
it seems to have predominantly selected particles or prepositions as its FCs (e.g.
ἄελπτος ‘unhoped for’, κασίγνητος ‘brother’ lit. ‘born together’), with the use of
nominal FCs gaining ground only in the Classical period. Passive adjectives in
-́ς afforded a higher flexibility, as there was no restriction on their being com-
pounded with nominal FCs.
     Moreover, forms in -́ς were more versatile than passive compounds of the
ὀρεσ́τροφος type, another Greek innovation which probably arose through the
semantic reanalysis of bahuvrihis (Chapter 2, section 5.2). In spite of their pro-
ductivity, ὀρεσ́τροφος compounds introduced another kind of inconvenience,
namely the fact they could only be formed from ablauting verbal roots. In the
light of these difficulties associated with the derivation of passive compounds,
the quick spread of -́ς formations becomes more understandable.83 At the same
time, because of their connection with the ‘stative’ -η- aorist, -́ς compounds
filled a gap left open by prior categories of active compounds by introducing a
type mostly associated with intransitivity.
     The next stage in the development of -́ς deverbative adjectives is their acqui-
sition of active semantics, a process which seems to involve stages of increasing
transitivity. However, while there exist exclusively passive or intransitive fami-
lies, no exclusively transitive one is to be found: this shows that the development
of a transitive meaning is a secondary stage in the evolution of the category, a
fact consistent with the hypothesis that -́ς compounds originated and evolved to
provide a morphologically flexible passive and intransitive type.84
     Our first examples of active compounds in Homeric Greek have, overwhelm-
ingly, intransitive or stative semantics (e.g. εὐρρές ‘well-flowing’, ἐριθηλ́ς
‘very-flourishing’), while θυμοδακ́ς ‘soul-biting’ is the only transitive compound
proper to be found.85 The development seems to have been prompted by seman-
82 See Paliuri (2014: 183–190), who refines the conclusions reached by Meissner (2006) on the
basis of the early evidence only.
83 See Meissner (2006: 194), who also points out that passive -ος compounds with a FC func-
tioning as the agent of the passive action are unattested in Homer. This might have further rein-
forced the need for a more versatile type of passive formation.

of the category.

tic reanalysis of bahuvrihis in -́ς, since there is a clear correspondence between
the early examples with an active meaning and the existence of neuter nouns in
-οσ-/-εσ-, while, according to Meissner (2006: 194), transitive forms are ‘largely
restricted to verbs whose root vowel could not ablaut’. It is only in the Hellenis-
tic period that deverbative -́ς compounds are used indiscriminately for both the
active and the passive meaning, by which point they have also come to be derived
from a large variety of verbal stems. We will study this development in relation to
those verbs which also produce V1 compounds.
     As we have seen, the extension of the -́ς type to a large number of verbs
is very likely connected to the need to develop a well-defined and morpholog-
ically free category specialized for the expression of semantic areas which are
not unequivocally covered by other V2 compounds. The productivity of individual
subtypes should therefore be analysed in view of the structure and productiv-
ity of other verbal compounds derived from the same root. In the next section,
our sole focus will be on active compounds in -́ς, since they provide a semantic
alternative to the V1 compounds collected in the Corpus. We will first tackle those
verbs for which the -́ς type is the main source of active V2 compounds (Class
IVa). Section 4.2.2 will briefly review the case of those active -́ς compounds,
mentioned in sections 3.1 and 3.2 above, which are created alongside other more
established V2 types.
4.2 -́ς formations as the main source of active V2 compounds
The seventeen verbs which produce exclusively active -́ς compounds (see section
2.3) represent only one tenth of the whole Corpus, but they manifest certain inter-
eresting phenomena in respect of their chronological development and inter-
action with other simple and compounded verbal derivations. Of these verbs,
only ἀλφάνω and πείθομαι produce agent nouns: ἀλφηστής ‘enterpraising man’
(Hom.) is a common form, while πειστήρ ‘one who obeys’ (Suid.) is a late hapax.
In both cases, there are no attested compounds of these agent nouns. There is
thus a clear correlation between the lack of agent nouns and the development
of active -ής compounds. Our analysis of the families which pair V1 compounds
with V2 compounds in -ής will be ordered chronologically, so that it starts with
those families in which the the V2 forms are already attested in the Archaic age.
ἀρκέω
This verb produces V1 PNs and only one appellative V1 compound. The com-
pounds seem mostly to retain the meaning ‘ward off’, as in the transparent
PN  ̓Αρκεσίλᾱος ‘one who wards off the enemy’; or ‘avail’, as in the appellative

ἀρκεσίβουλος ‘availing in council’ and probably also in the PNs  ̓Αρκεσίδημος,
 ̓Αρκέδημος and  ̓Αρκέφιλος (‘one who helps the people/his friends’).
     In the absence of agent nouns, ἀρκέω was to remain without V2 compounds.
However, bahuvrihis compounded with the neuter noun ἄρκος ‘defence’ (Alc.)
seem to have assumed a verbal meaning from early on. Achilles’ famous epithet
ποδαρκής is already an ambiguous form. Although from a structural point of view
it seems to be compounded with ἄρκος, the possessive meaning ‘whose defence/
means of defence is in the feet’ is not particularly satisfactory. It is possible, then,
that ποδαρκής was already formed as a verbal compound, meaning ‘succouring
with the feet’ (thus LSJ).86
     At any rate, direct derivation from the verb is undeniable for those fifth-cen-
tury forms in which the SC exhibits the secondary meaning of ἀρκέω ‘to be strong
enough, to be sufficient’: see αὐτάρκης ‘sufficient in oneself’ (Aesch.), πανταρκής
‘all-powerful’, down to ὀλιγαρκής ‘contented with little’ (Luc.). Most of these com-
pounds occur in prose texts, so that the category is not distinguished by being
particularly poetic. Meissner includes compounds in -αρκής among the earliest
examples of transitive -ής compounds, in which the FC functions as the object
of the verb. However, ἀρκέω is mostly intransitive, with its complements usually
being declined in the dative case, and its semantics range from the expression of
state (‘be sufficient’) to that of action (‘bring help, avail’).87 Compounds in -αρκής
therefore represent a typical example of the active-intransitive specialization of
the type in -ής and it is particularly plausible in this case that they were created
to complement an unproductive V1 type.
μαίνομαι
This is a family of compounds in which the V1 type is limited to μαίνανδρος ‘mad
after men’, attested in the late collection of Epimerismi attributed to Herodian.
The numerous V2 compounds in -μανής, on the other hand, appear as early as
Homer, with γυναιμανής ‘mad for women’. The starting point for this category is
the stative aorist ἐμάνην ‘I am furious, mad’. Forms in -μανής mostly correspond
to this stative-intransitive meaning of the base verb, which the FC completes
mostly as a complement of place (e.g. φρενομανής ‘mad in the mind’, Aesch.),
as a complement of manner (e.g. δοριμανής ‘raging with the spear’, Eur.), or as
a spatial limitation (e.g. ἀκρομανής ‘on the verge of madness’, Hdt.; ἡμιμανής
‘half-mad’, Aeschin.).
     The class is semantically diverse, however, and also comprises compounds
whose SC conveys a metaphorical idea of abundance: e.g. ἱππομανής ‘abound-

ing in horses’ (Soph., qualifying λειμών ‘meadow’).88 In θηλυμανής ‘maddening
women’ (Antim.) the SC acquires a transitive-causative meaning, which with the
passing of time seems to have become the default interpretation of many of these
compounds in -μανής: see e.g. Hesychius’ glossing of γυναιμανής as ἐπὶ γυναιξὶ
μεμηνώς, ἢ τὰς γυναῖκας ἐκμαίνων ‘being mad after women or making women
mad’ (Hsch. γ 1010).89 A handful of compounds also have a passive meaning,
with the FC indicating the agent: e.g. θεομανής ‘maddened by the gods’ (Aesch.),
οἰστρομανής ‘mad from the gadfly’s sting’ (Tim.). Most of the componds also
develop derivations in -ία and denominative verbs in -έω, a sign of the great pro-
ductivity of this type.
     Both because of the semantic range associated with the verbal SC and the
variety of the FCs with which it compounds, the category of compounds in -μανής
emerges as a unique type, especially since in early Greek compounds in -ής are
generally of the passive type. This flexibility reflects the productivity and range of
the base verb, but must also represent a response to the lack of other formations
(particularly adjectives) from μαίνομαι.
ἀλγέω
Compounds in -αλγής must have started off as bahuvrihis of ἄλγος ‘pain’ but—as
is the case with other -ής compounds corresponding to denominatives in -έω—
some forms may also have been derived directly from the verb. However, they
never achieve productivity as agentive compounds proper: θυμαλγής ‘heart-griev-
ing’ (Hom.) remains the only clear example of an object-verb relationship. V1
compounds are even more restricted: ἀλγεσίθυμος ‘grieving the heart’ (Orph. H.)
is clearly a late reversed form of θυμαλγής.
φαίνω
V1 compounds derived from φαίνω are limited to a few PNs, beginning with
Φαινεκλῆς (sixth c. BC), and one epithet, φαινομηρίς ‘showing the tight’ (Ibyc.): in
both cases, the FC extraordinarily retains the stem of the present φαιν- against the
simple root φαν-. It is the V2 type, represented by compounds in -φανής, which
proves to be the dominant one. These compounds are based on the intransitive
aorist ἐφάνην ‘appear, appear to be’ and become an extremely common type in
Greek, with over a hundred forms listed in Buck-Petersen. The meaning ‘appear-
ing, being visible’ is more common in early forms, such as τηλεφανής ‘appear-
ing from afar’, but post-Classical Greek develops a large number of forms in
which the SC -φανής means ‘seeming, having the appearance of’, e.g. γεωφανής

‘seeming like earth’ (Theophr.) or ταυροφανής ‘bull-like’ (Dion. Per.). The evolu-
tion of these forms mirrors that of compounds in -ειδής ‘having the appearance
of’: in both cases, the SC was progressively grammaticalized, almost acquiring
the function of a suffix meaning ‘like’.90 The development of this function may
have been connected to the needs of creating a transparent language for scientific
taxonomy.91
     It is apparent, then, that V1 and V2 compounds derived from φαίνω exhibit a
clear-cut distribution. V1 compounds reflect the transitive meaning of the active
voice φαίνω, whereas those in -φανής correspond to the meanings of the ‘passive’
aorist ἐφάνην and of the middle φαίνομαι. The great productivity of compounds
in -φανής is also due to their specialization in technical registers.
δέρκομαι
This verb does not seem to have been productive in the formation of V1 com-
pounds: the only possibility is to see one behind the Kurzname Δέρκᾱς (fourth
c. BC). V2 compounds in -δερκής, on the other hand, comprise one of the most
developed families of compounds in -ής and compensate for the lack of agentive
compounds and V1 formations. They appear early—an example is to be found
already in Hesiod’s Theogony (πολυδερκής ‘much-seeing’)—thus constituting
an early exception to Meissner’s claim that in Archaic Greek the active type
developed out of the reanalysis of bahuvrihis or from intransitive aorists in -η-:
δέρκομαι derives from an ablauting root and has a passive aorist in δρακ-, but the
active compounds all derive from the stem of present, δερκ-.
     The existence of three more forms in fifth-century Greek (ξανθοδερκής ‘with
fiery eyes’, lit. ‘looking yellow’, ὀβριμοδερκής ‘with a mighty glance’ in Bac-
chylides and ὀξυδερκής ‘quick-sighted’ in Herodotus) shows that this was not an
exceptional type, but a relatively well-established pattern. The semantics of these
forms is mostly intransitive and involves the qualification of the glance in ques-
tion: the FCs therefore tend to be adjectives used adverbially. The only substanti-
val FC too qualifies a type of glance: λιθοδερκής ‘whose glance is like stone, who
petrifies with a glance’ (Antiphil.).
θάλλω/θαλέω
V1 compounds derived from this root amount to only two PNs (Θαλησικλής,
perhaps ‘one who makes fame bloom’, Eretria third c., and Θαλησιγένης, perhaps
‘one who makes his race bloom’, Athens 146/5 BC). Their FC θαλησι- may derive
loosely from the stem of the sigmatic future θᾰλήσομαι, but it is more likely that

these forms are influenced by compounds in -θαλής. The vowel quantity of this
SC varies: forms in -θηλής (< -θᾱλής), attested already in Homer (e.g. νεοθηλής
‘fresh-budding’), seem to be connected to the perfect τέθηλα ‘to be in bloom’,
originally a stative formation.92 These are accompanied by forms in -θᾰλ(λ)ής,
which may either reflect the stem of the present θάλλω/θαλέω or derive from the
noun θαλλός ‘flower’ (also attested in the form θάλος with the specialized met-
aphorical meaning of ‘child’). The border between possessive compounds and
verbal ones therefore is not always clear-cut in this family, but the existence of
forms in -θηλής suggests that the verbal stem was functioning as a source of deri-
vations already in the Archaic age. Some of the forms in -θαλής, moreover, are not
easily interpretable as bahuvrihis from a semantic point of view: see for instance
ὀρειθαλής ‘blooming on the hills’ (Lycophr.).
     In this family, therefore, we witness the early development of an active -ής
type, a development which reflects the very low productivity of the V1 pattern.
The shape of the FC θαλησι- in the V1 pattern, moreover, points to the influence
of V2 compounds in -ής, a phenomenon which is observable also in other pairs of
this kind (see e.g. δάκνω).
τέρπω
V1 compounds derived from τέρπω begin with τερψίμβροτος and τερπικέραυνος
‘delighting in thunder’, both in Homer, and continue as an exclusively poetic type,
with new forms coined in Late Antiquity. PNs are a common type and are based
on both the s-aorist stem τερψ- and the present stem τερπ-. Compounds in -ής
compensate for the lack of agentive V2 formations. It is likely that they are derived
directly from the root rather than from the neuter noun τέρπος ‘delight’, which is
attested much later than the first compounds (SEG 3.774.8, first century BC–first
century AD) and looks like a back-formation from compounds in -τερπής.93 The
first forms, starting with Homer’s ἀτερπής ‘unpleasing’, are not compounded
with a substantival FC, but in later Greek the type in -τερπής fully replaces the
V1 pattern, which in the appellative domain is not particularly productive after
Bacchylides: see e.g. θεοτερπής ‘pleasing the gods’ (Philox.) and ὀχλοτερπής
‘delighting the mob’ (Poll.).
φείδομαι
This is a common verb, which survives into MG. Its V1 compounds are all ono-
mastic, with the exception of the denominative φειδαλφιτέω ‘to be sparing of
barley’ (cf. Phryn. P.S. epitome 121.9). Another fragment of Phrynichus’ Praepara-

tio sophistica (fr. 365), echoed by Suid. φ 243, also attests to the existence of the
adverb φειδαλφίτως ‘thriftily’. PNs derived from φείδομαι are all compounded
with common SCs, and some of these names appear to be meaningful: see the
Homeric Φείδιππος ‘one who uses horses sparingly’ i.e. ‘one takes care of horses’
(cf. Il. 5.202), later recast in the Clouds as the comic name Φειδιππίδης, which
denotes both the thriftiness of its bearer’s father and the obsession with aris-
tocracy of his mother;94 Φειδόμβροτος ‘one who spares men’ (cf. Il. 24.158), a
meaning probably conveyed also by Φειδεσίλεως and comparable forms; and
perhaps Φειδότιμος ‘one who has consideration for one’s reputation’. The relative
productivity of the V1 type is also shown by the existence of three different types
of FC: φειδε-, φειδι-, φειδεσι-.
     φείδομαι gives rise to a sort of agent noun characterized by the suffix -ων:
this is used as a PN, Φείδων, which is also employed in comedy for the comic type
of the thrifty person (as in Antiphanes fr. 189.22 K-A); it returns as an apposition in
the epigrammatist Nicarchus (AP 11.179). Pollux 10.169 moreover informs us that
φείδων was also the name of a type of oilcan that let only a little run out.
     V2 compounds in -ής are more restricted: they begin with the Homeric PN
Πολυφείδης and continue with the adjective ἀφειδής ‘not-sparing’, whose FC too
has an adverbial meaning. The only form in which the FC represents the direct
object of the verbal action is the much later βιοφειδής ‘sparing on sustenance,
penurious’ (Phil. Epigr.). In this case, compounds in -ής do not seem to have
developed in compensation for the low productivity of V1 compounds, and the
development of active -ής compounds from other verbs may in fact have been the
model for their creation.
φλέγω
This is a very common verb in both Classical and post-Classical Greek, where it
mostly appears in the preverbed form καταφλέγω ‘burn up’. The popularity of the
latter is shown by the fact that the only compound—καταφλεξίπολις ‘inflamer of
cities’, used by an anonymous poet of the Anthologia Palatina to describe a cour-
tesan—keeps the prefix κατα-. The same phenomenon is on view in the action
noun κατάφλεξις ‘burning’ (Luc.), which replaces φλέξις, attested only as a gloss.
     V2 compounds in -φλεγής, which feature already in Homer, predate the cre-
ation of V1 compounds. However, they are never compounded with a noun rep-
resenting the object of the verbal action, so that the category does not appear to
have been exploited for the formation of [N V] compounds.

φάω
V1 compounds are limited to the old Homeric epithet φαεσίμβροτος, usually
glossed as ‘bringing light to mortals’. However, Hesychius’ gloss φαέσασθαι· ἰδεῖν
(φ 28) suggests that the verb could also mean ‘to see’: if φαεσίμβροτος reflected
this sense, it would mean ‘seeing mortals’, which is particularly appropriate for an
epithet of Helios and Eos.95 Perhaps because of the limited use of the V1 pattern,
forms in -φαής became a convenient means of deriving verbal compounds from
this root. Compounds in -φαής clearly starts off as bahuvrihis of φάος ‘light’ (see
e.g. χρυσοφαής ‘having the shine of gold’, Sapph.), but the creation of verbal
forms is already a Classical phenomenon (e.g. νυκτιφαής ‘shining by night’,
Parm.) and may be ascribed to the interference of compounds in -φανής. Forms in
-φαής and -φανής meaning ‘shining’ or ‘appearing’ are often compounded with
the same FCs or attested as variae lectiones in the same text, so that it is not pos-
sible to make clear-cut distinctions between the two classes.
ἀλφάνω
This verb is rare and poetic, which may explain why there is only one V1 compound,
ἀλφεσίβοιος ‘bringing in oxen’, used twice in the Iliad as an epithet of παρθένοι,
and later by Aeschylus and Theocritus as an epithet of ὕδωρ. Ἀλφεσ́βοια was
also the name of a nymph. There is no morphological reason why V2 compounds
could not be created using the agent noun ἀλφηστής: we may note, however, that
given its meaning (‘earner, trader’), potential V2 compounds would have identi-
fied a kind of trader in something, a very different meaning from that of the V1
type. The only form in -ής is τιμαλφής ‘fetching a prize’ (Aesch.), connected to the
verb τιμαλφέω ‘do honour’ (Pi.).
βλάπτω
This is a common verb in Greek, but there are only two compounds in βλαψι-,
both poetic in character. After its first attestation in Aeschylus, βλαψίφρων ‘dam-
aging the mind’ is used only by Euphorion, Tryphiodorus and Eusebius, while
the hapax βλαψίταφος ‘violating the grave’ is attested in a fourth-century AD
funerary epigram. This low productivity could be due to the fact that compounds
in -βλαβής, either bahuvrihis from βλάβος ‘damage’ or verbal formations con-
nected to ἐβλάβην, are common. Forms with active semantics develop in the fifth
century, possibly starting with the shift in the meaning of ἀβλαβής from ‘without
harm’ (Sapph.) to ‘not harming’ (Aesch.). Especially in the Imperial age, active
compounds in -βλαβής with a substantival FC become a common pattern in
95 Knecht (1946: 9).

poetry, forming a group of synonyms whose FCs usually refer to bodily parts (see
Corpus).
πείθω/ πείθομαι
πείθω ‘persuade’ and its middle πείθομαι ‘obey’ are among the most common
Greek verbs. They create various FCs (πεισι-, πειθε-, πειθo-, πειθεσι-, the latter
only in PNs), which mostly seem to retain the meaning of the middle ‘obey’.
The compounds, frequent in both the appellative and the onomastic domains,
are productive down to the late Hellenistic age: the only later compound is
πειθοδικαιόσυνος ‘obedient to justice’ (PGM 5.403).
     The fact that compounds derived from πείθω are exclusively of the V1 type
can safely be linked to the lack of an agent noun, since the only time we find
one attested, πειστήρ ‘one who obeys’, it is in the Suda. Some V2 compounds
acquire an active meaning, partly in compensation for the lack of other agen-
tive forms. The early forms have adverbial FCs (e.g. ἀπειθής ‘disobedient’, Soph.,
εὐπειθής ‘ready to obey’, Pl.), followed by new forms such as ἑτοιμοπειθής ‘ready
to obey’ (Hdn.). The only compound which specifies the person whom one obeys
is θεοπειθής ‘obedient to God’ (Hierocles).
μισέω
V1 compounds derived from μισέω are quite productive. The meaning of the FC
μισο- is fully consonant with that of the base verb, while the various SCs specify
the object of hatred: e.g. μισόθεος ‘hating the gods’ (Aesch.) and μισοτύραννος
‘tyrant-hater’ (Hdt.). This type emerges in the fifth century BC and remains pro-
ductive throughout the history of Greek, being preserved in the modern language.
The productivity of these compounds is probably connected to the popularity of
their antonyms, compounds in φιλο-, from which it is likely that they import the
linking element -ο- (see Corpus and Chapter 4, section 3.1).
     The V2 type is limited to a few forms in -μισής, beginning in the fifth century
BC. In principle, these may have originated as bahuvrihis derived from μῖσος
‘hatred’, but a direct derivation from the verb is also possible. Their low number
can be understood in light of the huge popularity of compounds in μισο-.
στέργω
Though a fairly common verb down to Koine and Christian Greek, στέργω seems
to suffer from competition with φιλέω in the creation of compounds: its V1 com-
pounds come to two in total and are highly artificial. ἀστεργάνωρ ‘not loving men’
(Aesch.) is, together with ἀκερσεκόμης and ἀκειρεκόμης discussed in Chapter 5,
section 4.3, one of the very few negated V1 compounds: it may be analogical on
the negative adjective ἀστεργής ‘not loving’ (Soph.). στεργοξύνευνος ‘loving one’s

consort’ displays the typical artificiality of Lycophron’s compounds and is a hapax
(later only commented in the scholia to Lycophron). Apart from ἀστεργής, the other
active V2 compounds are formed on the o-grade and are late: τεκνοστοργής ‘full of
filial affection’ and ὁμόστοργος ‘feeling the same affection’ (Nonn.).
τήκω
Compounds derived from τήκω are limited and all poetic. The only V1 compound
is the post-Classical form τηξιμελής ‘consuming the limbs’, used by the epigram-
matist Philip. The same idea is conveyed by two later V2 compounds in -τακής,
γυιοτακής ‘melting the limbs’ (Antip. Thess.) and σαρκοτακής ‘wasting the flesh’
(Procl.). Their starting point is the intransitive aorist ἐτάκην ‘melt away, waste
away’ (attested from the fifth c. BC), but the compounds express a transitive-caus-
ative notion which is not associated with the -η- aorist and is typical, rather, of
the s-aorist. The first specimen is the late Classical form κατακυμοτακής ‘melting
the waves’ (Tim.), whose structure, with the preposition κατα- preceding the
object of the verb, κυμο-, is extraordinary and might perhaps be reminiscent of
the frequent Homeric phrase κατὰ κῦμα. Both the late development of the com-
pounds and their semantic and structural peculiarities identify this family as a
markedly artificial one.
χαίρω
V1 compounds appear from the sixth century BC onwards but, with the excep-
tion of χαιρεκακία ‘taking pleasure in one’s neighbour’s misfortune’ (Aristot.),
they are all onomastic. The FC is mostly built on the present stem χαιρ-, followed
by -ε, -ο, -ι, -εσι and even -ησι. V2 compounds in -χαρής, on the other hand, are
an extremely productive type, no doubt because of their formal association with
the aorist ἐχάρην. In most cases, these compounds reflect the intransitive seman-
tics of the -η- aorist: many FCs are adverbial and those which are substantival
mostly identify the thing in which one delights (e.g. μουσοχαρής ‘delighting in
the Muses’, Maecius, ἐπιδεσμοχαρής ‘bandage-loving’, Luc.). Only a few forms
in -χαρής express an active-transitive meaning: ὀχλοχαρής ‘courting the mob’ (M.
Ant.) and δημοχαρής ‘pleasing the people’ (Paul. Alex.; cf. the PNs Χαιρέδημος
and Χαρησίδᾱμος).
4.2.1 Summary of characteristics
If we consider the interaction between these early compounds in -ής and the
corresponding V1 compounds, we see that, on the whole, the -ής type seems to
have been developed to complement the V1 type, which is either predominantly
onomastic (see ἀρκέω, θάλλω, τέρπω, χαίρω), not attested at the time when the

first -ής forms appear (see μαίνομαι, φαίνω, δέρκομαι, φείδομαι, φλέγω, βλάπτω,
τήκω), or very limited (see φάω). Only the compounds in -μισής are less numer-
ous than their V1 counterparts, but, as noted, this may reflect the fact that com-
pounds in μισο- became a popular pattern in parallel with the very common ant-
onymic type in φιλο-.
     The earlier compounds in -ής are phonologically and semantically tied to
stative aorists in -η- and have, therefore, mostly intransitive semantics: see those
derived from μαίνομαι, φαίνω, βλάπτω and the later families derived from τήκω
and χαίρω. With the exception of compounds in -τακής, which are rare and late,
the V2 compounds derived from the stem of aorists in -η- are very popular types.
Those in -χαρής and -φανής develop into common patterns, and this is a possible
factor in the confinement of V1 compounds derived from those verbs to the ono-
mastic lexicon. At the same time, early bahuvrihi categories develop into verbal
types: we noted this for compounds derived from ἀρκέω, θάλλω, φάω and μισέω.
     Once the -ής pattern had become an established means of deriving verbal
compounds, including those of the active type, new categories were created inde-
pendently from an -η- aorist in order to complement unproductive V1 types: this is
particularly clear in the case of V2 compounds derived from δέρκομαι, φλέγω and
τέρπω (whose V1 compounds are mostly archaic), all of which employ the full-
grade root. Compounds derived from δέρκομαι, in particular, constitute a clear
case of the early development of a new word formation pattern whose function
was to compensate for the unproductive character of V1 formations derived from
the verb. V2 -ής compounds derived from presents may also be unproductive: this
always corresponds to the low productivity of both the base verb and the V1 type
(see the families derived from φείδομαι, ἀλφάνω and στέργω).
     The compounds analysed in this section confirm that -ής forms probably
developed to provide an easily formable type of compound endowed with verbal
semantics. This is consistent with the Greek trend towards right-oriented struc-
tures: when possible, the language resorts to V2 types which correspond to V1
compounds of low productivity. The only exception to this general trend are
compounds in μισο-, which remain much more productive than those in -μισής,
and the family derived from πείθω, where, as noted, the survival of both types is
linked to a distribution in which the V1 pattern corresponds to the transitive and
the V2 pattern to the intransitive meaning of the verb.
4.3 Active -ής compounds complementing other V2 types
The type in -ής also interacts with other agentive V2 types, and eventually replaces
a number of them. This development must be placed in the context of the great

expansion of the -ής type in post-Classical Greek, when the derivation from the
present had become a normal morphological process. The factors affecting the
make-up and productivity of particular types within individual families vary, but
we may note two general trends. On the one hand, these -ής compounds tend to
replace earlier unproductive V2 compounds; on the other hand, in the presence
of productive types, active -ής compounds remain one-off specimina, exceptional
instances of the mostly passive -́ς type. We will review these phenomena by first
focusing on some individual verbal families.
δάκνω
As noted in section 3.2, the type in -δήκτης is late and very rare: the original way
of creating V2 compounds from δάκνω was to resort to the -ής type. The early
existence of active compounds in -δακής can be explained on the assumption
that they are bahuvrihis, but the neuter noun δάκος is only attested in the spe-
cialized meaning of ‘obnoxious (biting) beast’ (Aesch.). There is thus a possibility
that already in Homer compounds in -δακής were derived directly from the verb.
     θυμοδακής derives from the zero-grade root employed in the present, given
that its regular passive aorist is ἐδήχθην (Soph.): ἐδάκην is only attested once
in Aretaeus, a second-century AD author. The shape of the SC -δακής may have
been influenced by the other Homeric compounds ending in -αής which were tied
to a stem in -η- (-αής < ἄημι, -δαής < ἐδάην). Later compounds in -δακής mostly
follow the structure of the Homeric model: their FCs are nouns functioning as
the direct object of the verb (λαιμοδακής ‘throat-biting’, Phil. Epigr., σαρκοδακής
‘biting flesh’, Orph. Fr.). A different structure is found in σηψιδακής ‘causing mor-
tification by its bite’ (Aristot.) in which the FC represents the result of the verbal
action, and ὠμοδακής ‘fiercely gnawing’ (Aesch.), in which the FC expresses an
adverbial modification.
     V2 compounds in -δακής are an exceptional case in that the -ής category is
attested before the V1 pattern. They are the productive, albeit still limited, pattern
for creating agentive compounds from δάκνω, while those in -δήκτης and V1 com-
pounds remain very rare.
φύω
V2 compounds in -φύτωρ are increasingly replaced by compounds in -φυής,
which seemingly start off as irregular bahuvrihis of φυή (see e.g. ἀφυής ‘without
natural talent’, Democr.) and later, under the formal influence of the intransitive
aorist ἐφύην ‘grow’, assume a verbal meaning, according to which the SC governs
the FC (e.g. πτεροφυής ‘growing feathers or wings’, Pl.). Forms in -φυής are par-
ticularly common in scientific terminology and represent the productive type,
compensating for the rarity of the V1 type and of forms in -φύτωρ.

                           4 V1 compounds and deverbative compounds in -́ς         329
φράζω
As noted in section 3.2, while V1 compounds are specialized as PNs, there is only
one V2 compound formed with the agent noun -φράστης: σκινδαλαμοφράστης
(Agath.). Some of the many compounds in -φραδής, on the other hand, have an
active meaning, starting with κακοφραδής ‘who thinks foolishly’ (Hom.): in this
case, too, the active -ής type develops early to compensate for the lack of other
agentive compounds.
πλήσσω
The very low productivity of V1 forms and V2 compounds in -πλήκτης, with
ἰσχυροπλήκτης ‘wounding severely’ in Hesychius the sole representative, is partly
compensated for by the fact that some compounds in -πληγής, deriving from the
full-grade root, have active semantics: φρενοπληγής ‘striking the mind’ (Aesch.)
and καρτεροπληγής ‘striking fiercely’ (D. S.). On the other hand, the type in -πλαγής,
deriving from the zero-grade stem of the passive aorist, is exclusively passive.
Relatively productive active compounds in -́ς which do not replace other common
V2 compounds are those derived from ἔρδω, τρέφω and ἔχω, verbs which all have
agentive compounds in -ος. Active forms in -εργής, -τρεφής and -εχής are mostly
late and represent the newest additions to fully developed compound families in
which the active semantics is already conveyed by V2 compounds in -ος and -της
and by V1 compounds, while compounds in -ής are mostly assigned the function
of expressing the passive voice. The following verbs from Class IV, too, have a few
(often late) active compounds in -ής among what is usually a larger number of
passive forms:
– ὄλλυμι > a few compounds in -ωλης (which are usually passive) also take on
     an active meaning, starting with πανώλης ‘all-destructive’ (Soph.); V1 and
     other V2 compounds derived from this verb are common.
– φεύγω > the low productivity of V2 compounds derived from this verb is not
     compensated for by the creation of -ής forms, the only instance of which is
     ἀφυγής ‘not fleeing’ (Timoth.).
– δέχομαι > there is only one -ής compound, πανδεχής ‘all-receiving’ (Pl.), since

     ‘touching gently’ (Arat.); though not very common, the only productive type
     are V1 compounds in ἁψι-.
–    πράσσω > there are only five late compounds in -πραγής, of which δυσπραγής
     ‘faring ill’ (Vett. Val.) is the oldest. All are compounded with adverbial FCs
     (εὐ-, κακο-, ἀδικο-, δικαιο-), so that their structure is not exactly comparable
     to that of other compounds derived from this verb. Each of these compounds
     in -πργής is also accompanied by an -έω verb of older date.96 Compounds in
     -πραγής are more numerous than compounds in -πράκτης.
–    ῥάπτω > compounds in -ρραφής are usually passive, but there are two active
     forms in Nonnus: λινορραφής ‘making nests’ (previously ‘sewn of flax’,
     Soph.) and δολορραφής ‘weaving treacherously’ (previously ‘woven treach-
     erously’, Opp). Compounds in -ρράφος are the productive type.
–    θέλγω > φρενοθελγής ‘charming the heart’ (Procl.), πανθελγής ‘charming all’
     (Nonn.). Other V2 compounds are equally rare; the productive type are V1
     compounds in θελξι-.
Many of the other families of -ής compounds derived from verbs of Class IV are
exclusively passive. Consider the following verbs, which are mostly ablauting
verbs with productive active compounds in -ος:
– φέρω > compounds in -φερής are attested from Homer onwards, but they
     are clearly selected for the expression of passive semantics: e.g. προφερής
     ‘carried before’ (Hom.).
– φθείρω > there are only two passive compounds, starting with πολυφθερής
     ‘subject to many forms of destruction’ (Emp.).
– λείπω > compounds in -λ(ε)ιπής, beginning in the fifth c. BC, are all passive.
– ῥήγνυμι: compounds in -ρραγής are passive except for ψυχορραγής ‘letting
     the soul break loose’ (Eur.).
– στέλλω > all compounds in -σταλής, starting with εὐσταλής ‘well-equipped’
     (Aesch.), are passive.
– ῥίπτω > compounds in -ρριφής, attested from the fifth c. BC onwards
     (δημορριφής ‘hurled by the people, Aesch.), are all passive.
– κάμπτω > δυσκαμπής ‘hard to bend’ (Plu.) and other passive compounds.
– πήγνυμι > ξυλοπαγής ‘built on piles’ (Str.) and other passive compounds.
– στρέφω ‘twist’: all compounds in -στραφής and -στρεφής are passive.
96 Paliuri (2014: 43) considers the possibility that these are examples of -ής compounds derived
directly from the -έω verbs.

                             4 V1 compounds and deverbative compounds in -́ς        331
To these forms we can add examples of passive compounds in -ής derived from
the verbs in Classes I and II which were analysed in Chapter 5 (verbs with no
active V2 compounds):
– βρίθω > compounds in -βριθής (e.g. σιδηροβριθής ‘iron-loaded’, Eur.);
– ζεύγνυμι > compounds in -ζυγής (e.g. νεοζυγής ‘newly yoked’, Aesch.);
– μείγνυμι > compounds in -μιγής (e.g. παμμιγής ‘all-blended’, Aesch.);
– στυγέω > bahuvrihis based on στύγος ‘hatred’ develop into a class of passive
     compounds, e.g. βροτοστυγής ‘hated by men’ (Aesch.).
Within this category of mostly passive compounds derived from verbs in Classes
I and II, there are some sporadic and usually late cases of isolated active com-
pounds. On balance, the appearance of these late or extraordinary formations
does not alter the impression that their base verbs were not involved in the devel-
opment of a productive category of agentive V2 compounds. Consider for instance
the following verbs, presented in chronological order:
– κράζω (Class II): ἀκραγής ‘not barking’ (Aesch.) is a hapax.
– ἕρπω (Class II): there is only χαμερπής ‘crawling on the ground’ (Olymp.
     Alch., fourth c. AD).
– ἐθέλω (Class II): there is only κακοθελής ‘malevolent’ (Adamantius Physiog-
     nomonicus, fourth c. AD).
– αὔξω (Class II): μυελαυξής ‘increasing the marrow’ (Hsch.) is a hapax.
– κρύπτω (Class II): there are only three compounds in -κρυφής, which appear
     from the fourth c. AD onwards; one of them develops active semantics in Byz-
     antine Greek: θεοκρυφής ‘hiding God’ (George of Pisidia).
From this overview we gain the impression that the -ής type, while attested for a
number of the verbal roots under consideration here, did not acquire the role of
rival to (or replacement for) active-transitive V2 compounds at any stage of Greek.
Neither does it provide a productive means of word formation for the verbs which
do not have other types of V2 compounds (Classes I and II). The small portion of
data collected here in connection with verbs which give rise to V1 compounds
serves as a useful means of refining our perception of the role of -ής compounds
in Greek, confirming that the priority in the development of verbal -ής compounds
was to provide Greek with a flexible method of forming passive verbal adjectives
rather than another type of active verbal compound. -ής compounds developed as
competition for passive adjectives in -τός and -ος (ὀρεσ́τροφος type) because in
the case of the first type the use of nominal constituents was restricted, whereas
the latter was morphologically confined to certain types of roots.
     At the same time, the morphological contiguity with the -η- aorist triggered
the early development of active-intransitive semantics, which was to become the

other identifying feature of -ής compounds throughout the history of Greek. Tran-
sitive semantics is tied to specific verbs, and these may produce an entire family
of transitive -ής compounds (e.g. ἀρκέω or δάκνω) or simply endow individual
forms with active meaning (e.g. ὄλλυμι, ῥάπτω, θέλγω). This might be due to the
productivity and diversification of the other active V2 categories, but the data in
this chapter have also shown that -ής transitive compounds tend to be sporadic
in the case of verbal roots which give rise to a productive V1 type covering active
and transitive semantics. It is perhaps worth stressing that the vast majority of
the transitive V2 compounds in -ής analysed in this section do not have FCs in
the function of direct object: the full verb-object relation is conveyed by V1 com-
pounds and by V2 compounds in -ος and -της. In the general conclusion we will
discuss the relevance of this evidence for the description of the Greek system of
verbal compounds as a whole.
5 Fulfilling the need of V2 compounds: other right-oriented
5 formations          5 Fulfilling the need of V2 compounds: other right-oriented formations
We lastly come to a small subclass (IVb) that deserves separate treatment in view
of the exceptional phenomena by which it is affected. This class contains five
verbs (ἀνάσσω, κρατέω, νικάω, φιλέω, φοβέω), not all characterized by high
productivity, which give rise to V1 compounds and to right-oriented forms that,
though formally compounded with nouns rather than verbal stems, in semantic
terms constitute V2 counterparts to the V1 compounds.
     In order to illustrate the characteristics of this group, let us start with ἀνάσσω
‘rule’. This is a denominative verb from the noun ἄναξ ‘lord’, which gives rise to
V1 compounds in ἀναξι-.97 In morphological terms, compounds ending in -αναξ
are compounds of the simplex and hence determinative compounds, expressing a
special type of ἄναξ: for instance, ἀστυάναξ is the lord of a city. However, because
of the close relation between noun and denominative verb, in semantic terms it is
impossible to separate ἀστυάναξ and a V2 compound such as στράταρχος ‘leader
of the army’. As discussed in Chapter 2 section 4.2, morphologists would class the
two forms differently (determinative vs. verbal compound), but in semantic terms
they are identical. What is more important, for the purposes of our investigation,
is that compounds in -αναξ constitute semantic counterparts to V1 formations
and must thus be included in our analysis if we hope to attain a more complete
understanding of the productivity of the latter.
97 For the formation of this denominative, see Ruijgh (1999: 530).

            5 Fulilling the need of V2 compounds: other right-oriented formations        333
ἀνάσσω
V1 compounds in ἀναξι- function both as appellatives and as PNs. The poetic epi-
thets are all attested in Bacchylides and Pindar for the first time, a fact which
Trümpy (1986) speculatively and controversially connected with the hypothesis
that the language of choral lyric would have preserved a core of very old forms
deriving directly from Mycenaean, in which ἄναξ is indeed an important term.
Of the forms attested in choral poetry, Bacchylides’ ἀναξίαλος ‘ruling the sea’,
ἀναξιβρέντᾱς ‘ruling the thunder’ and ἀναξίμολπος ‘queen of song’ are hapax
legomena, while ἀναξιφόρμιγξ in Pindar is later reused by Menander. The numer-
ous PNs in ἀναξι- are attested from the Archaic age onwards and remain popular
in post-Classical onomastics.
     Forms in -αναξ are compounded with FCs which do not find a parallel in the
V1 type. Apart from ἀστυάναξ, which is often attested in Greek sources because of
its use as the name of Hector’s son, the other compounds are rare forms: εὐρυάναξ
‘wide-ruling’ is another Bacchylidean creation, later only used by Gemistus as an
epithet of Poseidon (Bacchylides uses it as an epithet of Zeus); ἱππιάναξ ‘king of
horsemen’ (Aesch.) and εὐδιάναξ ‘ruler of the calm’ (Luc.) are hapax legomena.
Overall the impression we gain is that the V1 type was very much the more pro-
ductive.
κρατέω
This family of compounds neatly exemplifies the phenomena which characterize
Class IVb as a whole. In all likelihood, κρατέω is a denominative verb deriving
from the neuter noun κράτος ‘power’. This noun creates a class of bahuvrihis in
-κρατής (‘having power, force’, e.g. ἰσοκρατής ‘possessing equal rights’) which,
as is often the case with bahuvrihis in -ής corresponding to denominatives in -έω,
end up acquiring verbal semantics: see for instance the early ναυκρατής ‘master
of the sea’ (Hdt.) and αὐτοκρατής ‘ruling by oneself’ (Anax.). However, com-
pounds with clear verbal semantics are limited and generally post-Classical.
     Although later Greek possesses the agent nouns κρατήτωρ, which has the
specialized meaning ‘ruling star’ (Ptol.), and κρατητής ‘possessor’ (Procl.),
there are no regular agentive compounds derived from κρατέω. The V2 pattern
is covered by the very common type in -κράτωρ, starting with αὐτοκράτωρ ‘sole
ruler’ (Thuc.). The origin of these compounds is debated, as summarized in DEG
s.v. αὐτοκράτωρ. Benveniste (1973: 123), following an idea of Ernst Fraenkel,
maintained that -κράτωρ was an ancient neuter in -ωρ: this would have the con-
sequence that compounds in -κράτωρ were originally compounds of the simple
neuter noun (and thus determinative compounds). More plausibly, however, as
suggested by Schwyzer (1939: 531 n. 11), compounds in -κράτωρ developed out of
                                                        Olga Tribulato - 9783110415827

334         Chapter Six – The Analysis of V1 Compounds – Part II
those in -κρατής, which had begun to manifest purely verbal semantics: through
the use of the ending -ωρ these forms became agent nouns.
     This last hypothesis is also supported by considering the broader context of
the compound family of κρατέω as a whole. It makes sense that the language
should develop a convenient means of creating compounds with transparent
verbal semantics, and those in -κρατής are not very much exploited for this
purpose, perhaps because they were not verbal compounds in the first place
and the connection with κράτος was still transparent. By creating a new type in
-κράτωρ the language enables a verb without authentic agent nouns (or at least
without ancient ones) to make use of the V2 structure. From the fifth century
onwards, therefore, Greek acquires a class of compounds expressing the idea of
‘sovereign ruler’, which are of particular importance in political discourse: see
the above-mentioned αὐτοκράτωρ, to which we can add θαλασσοκράτωρ ‘master
of the sea’, featuring in Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon, and ναυκράτωρ
‘master of the sea’, used by Herodotus and Thucydides for the first time.
νικάω
V1 PNs in Nικο- and Nικησι- are extremely common in Greek, a fact which is at odds
with the complete lack of V1 appellatives. The verb produces three, apparently
post-Classical, agent nouns (νικᾱτήρ, νικήτωρ ‘victorious’ and νικητής ‘winner
in games’) but none of them is used in compounding. Semantically, the agentive
function is covered by compounds in -νικος and -νίκης, meaning ‘winner’. The
first of these types seemingly developed from bahuvrihis with νίκη ‘victory’, as is
suggested by the retention of the accent on the FC. This structure is still clear in
the oldest specimina, e.g. καλλίνικος ‘of beautiful victory’ (Archil.). The transfor-
mation into a fully verbal type is evident already in the language of the late sixth
c. BC, where we find forms such as Ἱππόνικος ‘winning with horses’ (PN, Simon.),
οὐρανόνικος ‘conquering heaven’ (Aesch.) and the derivation ἀεθλονικία ‘victory
in the games’, which presupposes **ἀεθλόνικος ‘winner of games’.
     Compounds in -νίκης, on the other hand, developed directly from the verb
through interference from νίκη, according to the process studied by Rüedi (1969)
(see Chapter 2, section 6.8). A good number of forms are to be found already in
fifth-century Greek and they probably played a part in the verbal reintepretation
of those in -νικος as well. V1 compounds therefore remained specialized as PNs,
while V2 compounds in -νίκης enjoyed great popularity in the appellative lexicon.
φιλέω
The compound family associated with φίλος and φιλέω is extremely productive.
Compounds in φιλο- are typically cited as the chief example of the development of
V1 FCs ending in -ο- from nominal forms, in this case the adjective φίλος (Chapter 4,
                                                     Olga Tribulato - 9783110415827

            5 Fulilling the need of V2 compounds: other right-oriented formations        335
section 3.1). It is possible that, in origin, compounds in φιλο- were bahuvrihis
in which the adjectival FC qualified a substantive: e.g. φιλόξενος ‘having guests
dear’, whose meaning subsequently developed into ‘loving guests’, with the con-
sequent creation of a genuine family of V1 compounds. These are productive at all
stages of the Greek language, in both onomastics and appellatives.
     In semantic terms, these V1 compounds compete with the very common
determinative compounds in -φιλος. As in the case of νικάω, a proper V2 category
ending in -φιλᾱς/-φιλης (later accompanied by a sigmatic and rare active type
in -φιλής) is derived directly from φιλέω, but these forms are not as prevalent as
those in -φιλος. V1 compounds in φιλο- are the most popular category from this
verb.
φοβέω
V1 compounds derived from this verb are not productive: φοβέστρατος ‘scaring
hosts’, an epithet of Athena (Hes.) and its elongated variant φοβεσιστράτη (Aris-
toph.) are the only forms. These compounds follow the semantics of the active
φοβέω ‘to scare someone’, whereas the bahuvrihis compounded with φόβος ‘fear’
which develop verbal semantics follow the meaning of the middle φοβέομαι ‘to
fear something’: ἄφοβος ‘without fear’ > ‘who does not fear’, ὑδροφόβος ‘having
terror of water’ > ‘fearing water’. Compounds with a substantival FC are rare,
however, and mostly post-Classical.
5.1 Summary of characteristics
Most of the right-oriented compounds in this subclass seem to have been created
to fulfil the need for V2 forms, particularly when that need is exacerbated by the
specialization of V1 compounds as PNs and their generally low productivity as
appellatives. We have observed this situation in the case of compounds derived
from νικάω: compounds in -νικος are an extremely popular pattern. In two cases
we have also witnessed the creation of V2 forms side by side with a V1 type which
remains more popular: this applies to ἀνάσσω and especially to φιλέω. Finally, the
balance between V1 and V2 forms is even in the case of both κρατέω and φοβέω,
although the former creates a much more numerous compound family than the
latter, a rare verb in compounding. Overall, the phenomena observed in Class
IVb confirm that Greek tended to develop right-oriented forms, but also kept and
sometimes multiplied V1 compounds connected with specific compound families
or derivational patterns (this particularly applies to compounds in φιλο-, which
share the popularity of other compounds characterized by the linking vowel -o-).

6 The stylistics of V1 compounds: a few final remarks
The above investigation has contributed new insights to the understanding of V1
compounds by providing a model of morphological analysis which, rather than
studying V1 compounds in isolation, seeks to investigate them in the context of
the larger system of agentive formations. Our analysis has, however, only cur-
sorily addressed the relation between V1 compounds, phraseology and stylis-
tics. The study of the bigger literary picture is beyond the scope of this book and
remains a largely unexplored field from a systematic point of view. The aim of the
next three sections is merely to consider samples of the kinds of questions which
arise from these areas of discussion with a view to highlighting issues deserving
of fuller examination.
6.1 V1 compounds and Greek comic language
Greek comic language has a predilection for compounds.98 This is partly due to
the fact that compounds afford a more condensed mode of expression, one of
the requirements of a successful pun, since they allow the author to place pos-
sibly unrelated concepts side by side. Hypertrophic formations such as those
mentioned in Chapter 2, section 2.2 are well-known examples of the degree of
sophistication achieved by compounding in comedy. On the other hand, com-
pounds are also numerous in comedy because of their perceived association with
high-style poetry, a frequent target of comic parody. In the latter category, we
may mention some V1 compounds seeimingly coined to play with serious poetry.
The neologism βροντησικέραυνος ‘thundering and lightning’ in Nub. 265, where
Socrates summons the Clouds with solemn language, is evocative of poetic and
religious language.99 The adjective is a clear allusion to the Homeric epithet of
Zeus τερπικέραυνος, but it is also employed to describe what is happening on
stage, with the chorus of clouds entering amidst special effects created with the
‘thunder-engine’ (βροντεῖον).100 On the surface, Aristophanes’ purpose is to give
a ceremonious feel to Socrates’ invocation through the use of a grand-sounding
epithet, but the audience may also have detected the tongue-in-cheek reference
behind its structure. As noted in section 3.2 above, word-play is also behind
Cratinus’ ἀγερσικύβηλις, a recherché neologism in a comedy abounding with
98 See the monograph by da Costa Ramalho (1952).

traditional prayers: see Willi (2003: 18–23).

tragic parody; similarly, Plato Comicus introduces the Homeric-sounding epithet
ἑλκετρίβων ‘cloak-trailer’ (section 3.1) to disparage a Laconian character.
      Tragic parody and allusion to poetic and religious registers are not always
easy to detect, but there is a chance that the use of some ‘serious’ V1 com-
pounds too is allusive or parodic. For instance, Aristophanes uses the adjective
ἀλεξ́κακος, usually said of Heracles or heroes, in reference to Hermes in Pax 422
and to himself in V. 1043. In both cases the use of the epithet may be serving
to reinforce a heightening in the register of the comedy: in Pax 422 ἀλεξ́κακος
comes at the end of the chorus’ and Trygaeus’ attempt to win Hermes over to the
human side, followed by the donation of the cup and the propitiatory libation
(l. 423–425), while in V. 1043 it is used to compare Aristophanes, whose art has
purified Athens from all her monstrous enemies, to Heracles. As in the Peace,
this passage ends with a libation and a solemn oath (1046–1047), both requiring
a heightened register.
      At the same time, it is common to find compounds which, while belong-
ing to an established type, create novel connections between the verbal idea
expressed by the FC and the SC: μελλοδειπνικός ‘(song sung) waiting for dinner’,
μελλονικιάω ‘delay victory’ (both Aristoph.: the latter is a word-play on Nicias’
name), μίξοφρυς ‘having eye-brows that meet’ (Cratin.), ἐθελόσυχνος ‘fond of
repetitions’, and λιποπωγωνία ‘want of a beard’ (both Crates Com.) are all drawn
from the common classes of compounds in μελλο-, μιξο-, ἐθελο- and λιπο- but
are at the same time comic inventions which appear in no other types of texts
except for lexicographical sources. Another common type, compounds in μισο-,
is exploited to create μισολάκων ‘hating Laconians’ and μισοπόρπαξ ‘hating
the shield-handle’ (both Aristoph.); neologisms beginning with φιλο- are also
particularly numerous (see Corpus under φιλέω). The FC παυσι- features in the
ingenious name of a collar worn by slaves while grinding corn to prevent them
from consuming the produce, the παυσικ́πη ‘ending the gulping-down’.101
      The V1 pattern is also exploited to create PNs that make a comic point about
the characters’ attitudes and activities, or to sketch their personality: in Aristo-
phanes, the FC of Strepsiades’ name ‘is a comment on his constant legal ‘twisting’
as well as his restlessness in bed’;102 Philocleon is an enthusiastic supporter of the
101 Cf. the explanation of the compound given by Aristophanes himself in fr. 314 K-A παύσειν
ἔοιχ ̓ ἡ παυσικάπη κάπτοντά σε ‘the collar seems to be stopping you from gulping down’.
102 Olson (1992: 307). This interpretation, based on the ancient scholia, had already been sug-
gested by Marzullo (1953: 115–119), who pointed out that Στρεψίδης must in origin have been an
equestrian name: ‘il povero Strepsiade, nemico giurato dell’ippica sua rovina, porta inconsape-
volmente un nome equestre’ (: Στρεψιππ́δης).

Athenian statesman Cleon and of his law-court frenzy, etc.103 Compound names
need not be absurd in order to make the audience smile: most of those found in
Aristophanes are historical names which, introduced at the right moment in the
plot, become speaking names highly relevant to the comedy’s themes.104 In this
way the historical name Pheidippides could be re-used for the horse-mad son of a
thrifty conservative and his aristocratic wife, and acquire the humorous meaning
‘son of the Spare-and-Horses’ vel sim.105 A few appellative compounds, in turn,
play with the names of historical or fictional characters to achieve a comic effect:
this is the case, for instance, with κλαυσίμαχος ‘rue-the-fight’ and βουλόμαχος
‘strife-desiring’ in Pax 1293, both alluding to Lamachus.106
     An amount of artificiality is of course to be expected in connection with
comic compounds. A few forms with the V1 structure do not have the expected
verb-object relationship, for instance χρεμψιθέατρος ‘spitting in the theatre’ (fr.
adesp. 1100 K-A), στρεψοδικοπανουργίαν ‘cunning in the perversion of justice’
and κεκραξίδαμας ‘who conquers all in bawling’ (both Aristoph.): the last two
are formed with two verbal stems. Structural analysis shows that in a number
of forms the FC does not derive from a verb but from an action noun, of which
it often preserves the semantics. An example is κρουσιδημέω ‘cheat the people’,
in which the FC acquires one of the meanings conveyed by the nomen actionis
κροῦσις ‘attempt to deceive’ rather than reflecting the semantics of the verb
κρούω ‘strike’. The reasons behind the creation of so many V1 compounds in
comic authors are certainly stylistic and peculiar to the comic genre, but the
frequency of τερψ́μβροτος-type compounds is perhaps also attributable to the
fondness of the comic style for -σις nominals.107
103 For such ‘speaking names’ in Aristophanes, see Kanavou (2011).
104 Bonanno (1987), Kanavou (2011: 11). Olson (1992: 306–307) notes that most Aristophanic
characters are identified by their name well into the play’s plot. Such delayed naming ‘allows
Aristophanes to establish a character or situation and then bestow a name as a final climatic
joke’.
105 For the ‘hybrid’ status of this name in the Clouds, which is also allusive of Alcibiades, see
Kanavou (2011: 71–72). The name itself is historical and based on Φέδιππος. According to Panagl
(1983), the original meaning of Φέδιππος was ‘one who releases horses’, following the mean-
ing of the IE root *bheid- ‘split, divide’. Later, since the Greek verb φέδομαι means ‘to spare’,
Φέδιππος was interpreted as ‘spare horses’: Panagl (1983: 303) points out that this paraetymo-
logical interpretation is already Homeric.
106 Olson (1998: 309).
107 This is often linked to parodic intentions: see Handley (1953: 141–142), Willi (2003: 134–136).

6.2 V1 compounds, technical language and scientific discourse
Another type of text in which V1 compounds may have followed a peculiar line
of development is scientific literature. The identification of technical language in
AG is a complex task: there are no clear structural properties that separate tech-
nical from standard terms; the distinction between ordinary and specialized lan-
guage is not reflected in a dichotomy between Greek words and those imported
from another language; the only texts we have at our disposal are literary in char-
acter; and it is often impossible to draw the line between science, philosophy and
even poetry’.108 The argument of Chapter 2, section 7.3, however, was that there
may indeed be categories of compounds that, though not exclusive to a particular
genre or register, are especially exploited by certain authors to create a scientific
terminology. Here we will consider how new V1 compounds were created to meet
the needs of technical language. Only those forms which unequivocally refer to
phenomena, objects and ideas that are ‘technical’ are included in Table 6.1 below:
epithets or words which do not pertain exclusively or especially to scientific dis-
course are omitted.

108 The question of whether we can hope to arrive at an objective identification of expert groups
of scientists in Antiquity, who shared the same language, is open to debate: see Dover (1997: 116),
Langslow (2000: 26–27). There are a few linguistic features that may point to the existence of a
coherent form of scientific discourse, which in turn may reveal the existence of specialist groups;
but we must never forget that these intellectuals are likely to have been active in a variety of very
different fields. See also Tribulato (2010) for a preliminary discussion of ‘scientific’ morphology.

τρεψίχρως               ‘changing colour’ (Aristot.)
These V1 compounds appear in works from different epochs, whose authors were
engaged in different kinds of ‘science’, from atomistic philosophy to medicine
and astronomy, but they do not seem to have constituted a popular pattern which
scientists would exploit to create families of scientific compounds.109 Rather, the
impression one gains from Table 6.1 is that the creation of new V1 compounds was
sporadic, perhaps prompted by necessity rather than the convenience of the V1
structure. The relative rarity of V1 compounds in these scientific texts may thus
reflect aversion to this compound type. This obviously cannot be taken to imply
that the V1 type was perceived as too artificial, since scientific language itself
often manifests a high level of terminological sophistication and remoteness from
common language. Rather, it is possible that the V1 category was felt to be mark-
edly poetic.
     A closer inspection of the types of V1 compounds found in scientific lan-
guage provides evidence in this direction. With the exceptions of compounds
derived from ἀμέβω and ἔχω, all V1 forms in Table 6.1 belong to verbs which do
not give rise to V2 compounds (αὔξω, λείπω) or whose V2 pattern is not produc-
tive (κλέπτω, λύω, μείγνυμι, μιμνήσκω, τρέπω). It is likely, therefore, that these
V1 forms were created according to the disfavoured V1 pattern because no other
structure was available. This explanation is consistent with the general conclu-
sions reached by the present study concerning the factors behind the productivity
of many V1 families.
6.3 V1 compounds, phraseology and Greek Dichtersprache
Since V1 compounds function as condensed verbal phrases, they often corre-
spond to attested Greek expressions. Insights into the relationship between com-
pounding and IE or Greek phraseology can be found in a variety of contributions
dealing with individual compounds (particularly PNs),110 and especially in a
109 See, by contrast, my analysis of ‘families’ of scientific compounds in Theophrastus’ botanical
writings in Tribulato (2010: 491–493).

number of articles by J. L. García Ramón.111 However, we still stand in need of a
more systematic investigation into the interface between phraseology, poetic lan-
guage, and compounds. Rüdiger Schmitt’s 1973 Indogermanische Dichtersprache
und Namengebung only offers a brief sketch of the issue, while Schramm’s 1957
Namenschatz und Dichtersprache is confined to Germanic.
     Research into Greek and IE phraseology is especially enlightening for our
understanding of PNs, the meaning of which we are often unable to grasp solely
on the basis of the semantics of their two constituents. We have seen in Chapter 2,
section 8, that ‘meaningless’ or ‘irrational’ PNs are not an infrequent phenome-
non in Greek. We cannot always be sure of the process that led to their formation,
but it appears that a number of meaningless names result from the juxtaposition
of two constituents which originally belonged to ‘meaningful’ names. An example
is provided by compounds with the FC δαμασι- from δ́μνημι ‘to tame’. The names
Δαμασικλῆς and Δαμασικράτης, both attested from the middle of the fourth
century onwards, ultimately make little sense: judging by their constituents, they
might mean ‘taming fame’ and ‘taming power’ respectively, but these meanings
are less than satisfactory. Such forms become more understandable once we con-
sider that the FC δαμασι- first occurs in the names Δαμασίστρατος ‘one who tames
the (enemy) army’, Δαμασάνωρ ‘one who tames men’, and Δαμάσιππος ‘one who
tames horses’, which have perfectly clear meanings and evoke imagery associ-
ated with war and horsemanship. The FCs -κλῆς and -κρατης are common in
bahuvrihis such as Πατροκλῆς and Πασικρ́της: Δαμασικλῆς and Δαμασικράτης
thus result from the conflation of these two types.
     We might call both Δαμάσιππος and Πατροκλῆς ‘primary’ compound names,
and Δαμασικλῆς a ‘secondary’ compound name.112 The fact that a PN looks ‘mean-
ingless’ should not prevent one from searching for possible phrases from which it
might have derived, and thus finding a means of accounting for its structure.113 It
is at this point that phraseology and research into attested phrases containing a
verb and its argument (in either order) come into the picture, as they may reveal
that there is a rational pattern behind a seemingly meaningless V1 PN.
     We must also reflect on the fact that such an analysis may yield different
results depending on whether it is limited to Greek or takes other IE languages and
the historical perspective into consideration. Accordingly, a methodological issue
arises: can we call ‘irrational compounds’ those forms which make little sense
from the point of view of Classical Greek semantics, but which, if traced back to
an earlier period, might well be perfectly explainable? To return to the name of

Strepsiades’ son in the Clouds, Pheidippides (see above), this suddenly becomes
more transparent if we suppose that it was formed at a time when *bheid- still had
the meaning ‘split, separate’, and then reflect on the fact that the releasing of
horses was a common enough action in societies in which the horseman held a
position of great prominence.114
     Leaving the comparative perspective aside, since it would certainly require
a study in its own right, we shall now focus on a selection of compound families
in order to give a sense of what the analysis of phraseology can achieve. These
families have been taken from our Corpus of V1 compounds, with the exception
of (1) families represented by Kurznamen or forms of difficult etymology; (2) com-
pounds derived from ἄρχω, since their FCs often have no governing function at
all.
6.3.1 Epithets and PNs
Epithets can sometimes evoke rather unusual ideas, but in most cases they qualify
a person by referring to his or her most characteristic qualities or actions. In this
respect, V1 compounds often exhibit combinations of elements which are attested
in parallel phrases. Divine epithets for instance often refer to the gods’ ability to
strike the earth and make it shake; among these, ἐλασίχθων ‘earth-striking’ (Pi.)
refers to an action described in Hom. H. Ap. 333 ἔλασε χθόνα ‘[she] struck the earth’,
while ἐλελίχθων ‘earth-shaking’ (Pi.) finds a parallel in the image ἐλέλιξε δὲ μακρὸν
Ὄλυμπον ‘[Hera] made the mighty Olympus shake’ (Il. 8.199). βλαψίφρων ‘pervert-
ing the mind’, first attested in Aeschylus, is a short way of expressing the effect of
the gods’ maddening power, for which cf. Il. 15.724 ἀλλ ̓ εἰ δή ῥα τότε βλάπτε φρένας
εὐρύοπα Ζεύς ‘but if far-seeing Zeus did indeed warp my mind then ...’.
     Among the many Homeric epithets which are supported by Homeric phrases,
compare ἀγαπήνωρ ‘loving men’ (Hom.) with Il. 24.464 ἀθάνατον θεὸν ὧδε
βροτοὺς ἀγαπαζέμεν ἄντην ‘[for it would be a shameful thing] that an immortal
god should love mortal men thus openly’ and βωτιάνειρα with Od. 11.365 βόσκει
γαῖα μέλαινα πολυσπερέας ἀνθρώπους ‘the dark earth breeds men scattered
far and wide’. Other epithets or names may of course have parallels in phrases
attested in other authors. Continuing with forms drawn from the vast cohort of
compounds derived from ἔχω, we may mention ἐχενηίς ‘ship-holding’ (Aesch.)
and Od. 10.91 ἔνθ’ οἵ γ’ εἴσω πάντες ἔχον νέας ἀμφιελίσσας ‘then all held their
curved ships in’, ἐχεμυθία ‘silence’ and Od. 19.502 ἀλλ ̓ ἔχε σιγῇ μῦθον ‘hold the
matter in silence’.

                             6 The stylistics of V1 compounds: a few inal remarks       343
     For a selection of actions frequently celebrated in onomastics, we may quote
the following verbs and their productive V1 compounds:
ἀρτύω (section 3.2)
 ̓Αρτύλοχος is the warrior who ‘prepares an ambush’ (= Od. 14.469 ̔ς ὅθ ̓ ὑπὸ
Τροίην λόχον ἤγομεν ἀρτύναντες ‘as when we made ready our ambush and led
it beneath Troy’),  ̓Αρτύμαχος is probably the person who gets the army ready
for battle (cf. Il. 11.216 ἀρτύνθη δὲ μάχη ‘and the battle was set in array’), while
 ̓Αρτυσίλεως and  ̓Αρτύλᾱος can be understood as ‘putting the army in order, pre-
paring the army’ in the light of Il. 12.43 πυργηδὸν σφέας αὐτοὺς ἀρτύναντες
‘putting themselves in order, dressing their ranks like a tower’.
δαμάζω (section 3.1)
Δαμασίστρατος ‘taming the enemy army’ and Ζευξίδᾱμος ‘subjugator of the
people’ find a parallel in Aesch. Pers. 278–279 πᾶς δ ̓ ἀπώλλυτο στρατὸς δαμασθείς
‘the whole army perished, overwhelmed’ and Ctes. Fr. 3c.688.F.13.120 ζευγνὺς τὴν
Ἄβυδον ‘having subjugated Abydos’ respectively (in this last case the phrase does
not refer to the subjugation of people, but to that of the city of Abydos).
ἐρύκω (Chapter 5, section 5.3.2)
 ̓Ερυξίλᾱος refers to the action of restraining the enemy, for which cf. Il. 24.658
λαὸν ἐρύκω ‘Ι keep back the host’.
εὔχομαι (Chapter 5, section 5.3.1)
Τhe origin of the PN  ̓Ευξίθεος ‘one who prays to the gods’ can be traced back to
phrases such as Il. 3.296 εὔχοντο θεοῖς ‘they prayed the gods’
6.3.2 Epithets and names in -ιππος
Even in the small corpus under consideration, compounds in -ιππος play an
important role and can be explained in the light of attested phrases. ἐλάσιππος
‘driving horses’ describes a common action, cf. Il. 23.357 Τυδεΐδης ὄχ ̓ ἄριστος ἐὼν
λάχ ̓ ἐλαυνέμεν ἵππους ‘the son of Tydeus, though far the best, drew a lot to
drive his horses’. The PN  ̓Αγάσιππος refers to a person who appreciates horses
and is able to select them: cf. Xen. Eq. 4.1 Ὅταν γε μὴν ἀγασθεὶς ἵππον πρίηταί
τις... ‘When a man, having found a horse which he likes, buys it...’. Similarly, the
Laconian name Αἱρήhιππος describes someone who is good at capturing horses,
while Ἅψιππος refers to another action performed by horsemen, the striking of
the horse to quieten it, cf. Xen. Eq. 6.14.3 (which explains that, if the horse is shy

of anything, the owner should touch the horse and gently lead it to whatever is
causing the fear).115
6.3.3 Other compounds and their corresponding phrases
Among the other V1 compounds for which it is possible to identify parallel
phrases, we may mention the following ones derived from verbs in Classes I and II:
αἱρ́ω (Chapter 5, section 5.3.2)
αἱρησιτείχης ‘taker of walls’, the title of a play by Diphilus, is the compound form
of a common set of expressions, e.g. Isoc. Ep. 2.21 κάλλιόν ἐστιν τὰς εὐνοίας τὰς
τῶν πόλεων αἱρεῖν ἢ τὰ τείχη ‘it is so much more beautiful to conquer the favour
of cities rather than their walls’ and Xen. Hell. 4.5.5 τὸ ἐντετειχισμένον τεῖχος
αἱρεῖ ‘[the regiment] captures the fortified stronghold [of Oenoe]’.
ἀκέομαι (Chapter 5, section 5.3.1)
Νames such as  ̓Ακέσανδρος and  ̓Ακεσίμβροτος, and appellatives such as
ἀκεσσίπονος ‘healing toil’ (Nonn.) find parallels in several phrases: see for instance
Democr. fr. 31.2 σώματος νόσους ἀκέεται ‘[it] heals the diseases of the body’.
ἀνύω (Chapter 5, section 5.3.2)
ἀνυσίεργος ‘finishing work’ (Theocr.) corresponds to phrases such as Od. 16.373
ἀνύσσεσθαι τάδε ἔργα ‘[since I do not believe that, as long as he lives,] this work
will be accomplished’.
ἅπτω (Chapter 5, section 5.3.1)
Τhe word for ‘skirmish’, ἁψιμαχία (Plu.) and the PN Ἁψιμάχις (Macedonia 3rd c.
AD), have parallels in Hdt. 6.108.5 συνάπτειν μάχην ‘join battle’ and Megasth.
Fragm. 38a.38 οὐκ αὐτίκα μάχης ἅπτονται ‘they do not start fighting imme-
diately’; ἁψικάρδιος ‘heart-touching’ (M. Ant.) has a parallel in Eur. Hel. 960
καρδίας ἀνθάψεται ‘[that which] shall touch (your) heart’.
βούλομαι (Chapter 5, section 4.3)
Aristophanes calls Lamachus βουλόμαχος ‘a man who desires strife’, which is far
from unheard of in contemporary literature, cf. e.g. Thuc. 4.91 βουλόμενος τὴν
μάχην ποιῆσαι ‘wanting to make battle’.

7 Conclusion
The compounds analysed in this chapter in part confirm the traditional view of
Greek V1 compounds: namely that they are less productive than V2 compounds
and are generally used in onomastics and poetry. The in-depth analysis of the
interaction of V1 and V2 compounds within individual families, however, has also
shown that this traditional view must be refined in a number of crucial respects.
The starting point of our approach has been to organize the verbs which produce
both V1 and V2 compounds into four different subgroups, based on whichever
type the V2 compounds fall under. Within the large Class IV, which contains V2
compounds of the -ος and -της types, the important distinction is between pro-
ductive and unproductive families. Productive families tend to exhibit a neat dis-
tribution, whereby V1 compounds are mostly productive as PNs, while V2 com-
pounds are mostly productive as appellatives (see summary in section 3.1.1). This
is consistent with our hypothesis that Greek tended to increase its right-oriented
types: in these cases, V1 compounds were preserved primarily for onomastic pur-
poses. Families in which this distribution is especially apparent are those derived
from ἄγω, δέχομαι, ἔρδω, ἡγέομαι, ἵστημι and σώζω. However, the crucial point
to bear in mind is that these onomastic V1 compounds represent a functioning
means of word formation rather than a dying relic: the analysis of the V1 com-
pounds in this group has consistently confirmed the high productivity of this
type.
     Less productive families, on the other hand, exhibit a less predictable dis-
tribution of forms, and one which is greatly affected by the productivity and
semantic restrictions of their base verbs. Unsurprisingly, the number of V1 com-
pounds decreases in the presence of productive V2 compounds, and the type is
often tied to a particular linguistic domain: onomastics (e.g. compounds derived
from ἔραμαι, πράσσω or τιμάω) or poetic language (e.g. compounds derived from
βόσκω, ῥάπτω, φθείρω). On the other hand, rare V2 compounds are not necessar-
ily compensated for by an increased number of V1 forms, a phenomenon which
can only be accounted for in the light of the behaviour of their base verbs. On
the whole, however, even in the case of these less productive families we are not
given the impression that V1 compounds were a limited category in Greek: the
success or unsuccess of individual families is largely determined by the peculiar-
ities of their base verbs, and not by the V1 pattern itself.
     The analysis of V2 compounds in -ής conducted in section 4 has been a useful
means of confirming the Greek trend towards right-oriented structures. As noted,
this verbal type was specialized for the expression of passive and stative seman-
tics, but was occasionally also exploited for the expression of active (though
mostly intransitive) semantics. In the case of the seventeen verbs of Class IVa,

which lack V2 compounds in -ος and -της, these forms in -ής, albeit with differ-
ences across the individual families, clearly constituted the productive type of
compound: their V1 parallels are mostly rare or at any rate less numerous than
those in -ής (an exception are compounds in μισο-).
     The few verbs in Class IVb analysed in section 5 display some peculiar behav-
iours, and this must be connected with the fact that neither their V1 nor their V2
compounds are verbal in origin. Thus, the immense popularity of compounds
in φιλο- seems to be due (at least in part) to the fact that its FC derives from an
adjective (although it was connected to the verb φιλέω). The left-oriented com-
pounds of this class are generally quite common (an exception is φοβέω, whose
V2 compounds, however, are also rare) but again they are mostly productive in
onomastics.
     Within a compound system which privileges right-oriented V2 formations, V1
compounds often provide useful alternatives for the expression of special mean-
ings and a structure which continues to be favoured in the onomastic and poetic
domains. With the help of the survey provided in this chapter we have also been
able to show that factors other than those of a morphological nature are at play
in determining the creation and development of individual V1 families. In many
of the individual analyses of verbs producing V1 compounds there was scope for
issues of style and literary language to come to the fore, and the brief overview
in section 6 also tackled the influence of phraseology and register variation in
particular literary genres (comedy and scientific texts) as well as in onomastics.
No attempt has been made to investigate systematically the role and structural
characteristics of V1 compounds in the AG literary genres, but the short survey
provided here shows that such a topic certainly deserves a study in its own right.

This book has provided an investigation of the diachronic development of AG
V1 compounds, from the reconstructed phase of late PIE to the linguistic stage
represented by late-antique texts. The analysis has adopted historical linguistics
as its main methodological framework, but it has also taken account of theories
developed by morphologists for the study of compounding cross-linguistically.
Chapter 1 addressed compounding from a typological point of view, while at the
same time providing a general introduction to the peculiarities of AG compound-
ing. Its defining characteristic is the use of stems, which in some FCs are followed
by linking elements (e.g. πυρ-ο- from πῦρ ‘fire’). In comparison to the later stage
of development represented by MG, stems and linking elements both present a
high degree of variation in AG (section 4.2). V1 compounds, too, are synchron-
ically formed from a variety of stems/root grades (Chapter 4, sections 3–4), and
formal analysis of their FCs has been central to the formulation of theories con-
cerning the origin of this category in PIE.
     The methodological assumption underlying the investigation pursued in
this book is that V1 compounds should be analysed in the context of the Greek
compound system, whose main categories were described in Chapter 2. Among
the various areas of interest addressed in this chapter, the following have proven
especially relevant to the analysis of V1 compounds:
     (1) The development of AG V2 compounds into endocentric [N N] structures.
This tendency is initiated by the creation in Greek of an exclusively substanti-
val type of agentive compound formed with the suffix -της. Such compounds are
mostly reserved for expressing well-defined masculine agents and diverge in that
respect from those in -ος, which—being nouns or adjectives—are less semanti-
cally restricted and have a larger range of applications, since they can qualify
masculine, feminine and neuter nouns and acquire either an active or passive
voice. It was noted in section 6.9 that these properties make agentive compounds
in -ος quite similar to V1 compounds. This observation receives further support
from the analysis, provided in Chapter 6, of competing V1/V2 pairs: when the
individual types of V2 compounds in these pairs are compared, it emerges that
those in -ος have higher productivity than those in -της. The situation in MG rep-
resents the outcome of the trend which took shape in Classical Greek: while agen-
tive compounds in -ος are still a productive type (whereas V1 compounds are not,
                                                                 Olga Tribulato - 9783110415827

except in some dialects),1 they have become manifestly substantival in nature,
losing those adjectival functions they previously fulfilled.2 Chapter 2 argued that
this process of conversion of V2 -ος compounds into an exclusively substantival
category has its roots in Classical Greek, where the presence of -ος agentive sim-
plicia may have encouraged the use of the corresponding compounds as nouns,
with the result that the class as a whole was interpreted as an [N N] type. Cru-
cially, this situation no longer applies in MG, where the verbal SC of these forms
is most often a bound stem inherited from AG.3 The understanding of MG verbal
compounds in -ος could therefore benefit from a study which takes into consider-
ation the evolution of agentive compounds in AG.
     (2) The development of determinative compounds over time, which can be
viewed in the context of the more general Greek trend towards endocentricity
(section 4.7). A degree of overlap with determinative compounds has been noted
in connection with some of the V1 types analysed in Chapters 5 and 6, particularly
those in ἀρχι-, μιξο, and ἐθελο-. These may represent examples of incipient gram-
maticalization, in which the FC has lost its governing function and has become or
is close to becoming a prefix modifying the SC.
     (3) The transition of verbal compounds in -ής from their original stative/
passive function to the expression of the active voice is also an integral part of the
peculiar development of the AG compound system. These compounds are mainly
intransitive but a few also have the same active semantics as V1 compounds, to
which they provide an alternative (albeit a limited one: see Chapter 6, section 4).
     (4) Apart from the cross-linguistically common forms with a verbal or prep-
ositional FC, AG also developed a number of left-oriented categories which have
never been comprehensively studied. As noted in sections 7.2–7.4, a high degree
of interference from syntactic structures is apparent in the make-up of these com-
pounds: in those with an adjectival FC (analysed in section 7.4), the left-orienta-
tion is clearly due to the governing nature of the FC, while others are seemingly
influenced by frequent noun + genitive phrases, which may have attained the
status of ‘phrasal terms’ in specific registers (section 7.3). Analysis of these forms
enabled us to see that V1 compounds are not an isolated type: their orientation
and close relationship with phraseology find parallels in other left-oriented for-
mations. Many of the Greek left-oriented categories are therefore not rare excep-
tions, but relatively prolific types whose structure is determined by the nature of
their FC, and by the morphological and syntactic properties which this displays.

 Conclusion – V1 Formations and the system of verbal compounds in Ancient Greek        349
     It is precisely the interplay of morphology and syntax in the formation
process of V1 compounds which is the focus of many analyses of this category in
Greek. These were reviewed in Chapter 3, which paid special attention to theories
that identify the FC of V1 compounds with verbal stems (sections 4 and 8) and to
early studies of the impact of syntax and word order on the structure of V1 com-
pounds (sections 5, 7 and 8). Following both older and more recent approaches to
V1 compounds in ancient and modern languages, which identify their FCs with
stems, Chapter 4 advanced the view that the elements contained in the FCs of the
Greek φερέοικος, τερψίμβροτος and βωτιάνειρα types are verbal roots or stems
and rejected the hypothesis that some of these FCs might originally have con-
tained nouns. The chapter proposed a model for the historical evolution of V1
compounds in the IE languages. It submitted that PIE possessed two types of V1
compounds (those in -e- and those in -ti-), which were later lost or re-interpreted
in Indo-Iranian and West IE, and were preserved and further developed in AG
(section 2). The presence of rare V1 compounds in the onomastic stock of Germanic
languages can be explained with reference to the influence of Late Latin and early
Romance, where the V1 type is productive. In Late Latin, V1 compounds arose inde-
pendently from the old PIE type (which Classical Latin appears to have lost), prob-
ably as a result of shifts in the word order patterns of the language. The evaluation
of the Slavic evidence as a whole is more problematic: although the few East Slavic
V1 compounds have been explained as borrowings, the more extensive evidence
of such formations in South Slavic and the presence of a few V1 compounds in Old
Church Slavonic may point to the continuation of the inherited type.
     As far as AG is concerned, the high productivity of two separate types of V1
compounds (φερέοικος and τερψίμβροτος) as well as the preservation of isolated
forms of the βωτιάνειρα type raises two questions: firstly, whether all three types
were inherited from an older linguistic stage; secondly, what factors determined
the survival of a left-oriented verbal category in the AG right-oriented compound
system. In dealing with the first question, the analysis provided in this book dif-
fered from previous investigations of the dynamics behind the genesis of the V1
type in PIE. Although we subscribed to the view that syntactic structures can
influence patterns of word formation, our analysis did not concern itself with
the possible impact of PIE syntax and constituent order on the structure of com-
pounds. The idea that V1 compounds might reflect a marked word order and/or
imperatival phrases is not to be discarded, but it is largely unverifiable, and not
particularly useful for understanding the meaning and development of V1 com-
pounds in the individual IE languages. By contrast, the investigation of PIE verbal
morphology vis-à-vis types of verbal compounds is a more rewarding enterprise,
since it can provide hints as to the way in which compound constituents might
have been selected.

350         Conclusion – V1 Formations and the system of verbal compounds in Ancient Greek
     Accordingly, Chapter 4 focused on the formal make-up of the FCs of V1 com-
pounds rather than on the impact of word order, and advanced the hypothesis
that at an early linguistic stage V1 compounds were formed using simple roots, in
parallel with the behaviour of these roots in the PIE verbal system. V1 compounds
based on roots whose primary formation was the root present selected the the-
matic radical present stem (characterized by -e-). The Greek φερέοικος type
extends this latter formation process to a large number of verbs whose present
formation is not of the root type (e.g. λανθάνω): the FCs derived from them are
usually formed on the simple root followed by -ε-. In the case of secondary
presents such as λανθάνω, this often corresponds to the thematic aorist stem
(λαθ-ε-), a fact which brings out the extent to which AG innovated on the original
derivational system posited here. On the other hand, the Sanskrit type of com-
pounds in -a- (< -e-) has only been cursorily examined in this book: a thorough
morphological investigation of the types of stems behind the FC of such Vedic
compounds in -a- vis-à-vis the Greek ones is a desideratum.
     V1 compounds derived from roots whose primary formation was the root
aorist were marked by presence of the element -ti-, in which -t- appears to have
been imported from V2 root compounds, while -i- is merely a linking vowel. This
element might have come into existence after an initial stage in which FCs could
have contained the mere root, as in Greek form Τληπόλεμος and in the Vedic sth-
raśman ‘making reins firm’ (Chapter 4, section 2.1). In Vedic and Greek—the only
two languages where these -ti- compounds are attested—this category is clearly
a rarity. Following work carried out by Nielsen Whitehead (2012), our conclusion
was that the Vedic -ti- compounds constitute a rather artificial type of ‘reversed
bahuvrihis’, probably the result of reanalysis of the inherited type (section
4.3.2). In Homeric Greek, by contrast, -τι- compounds have a clear V1 structure
(no re-analysis has taken place), but they are confined to PNs and rare epithets.
The evaluation of the Mycenaean evidence for V1 compounds in -ti- provided
in Chapter 4 proved to be essential for understanding the factors at play in the
preservation or loss of individual -ti- compounds. The hypothesis that -ti- marked
compounds derived from roots whose primary formation was the root aorist was
tested on a number of such Mycenaean FCs (e.g. those derived from ἀραρίσκω or
ὄρνυμι). These preserved the [ti] cluster against Mycenaean assibilation to ensure
morphological transparency, particularly in those cases where the prospective
assibilated FCs in -si- would not be supported by an existing s-aorist (e.g. those
derived from ἀραρίσκω, analysed in 7.1; the same applies to the Homeric form
βητάρμων, analysed in 8.3). In other FCs, on the other hand, [ti] was prevented
from assibilating or palatalizing because of the phonetic environment in which
it found itself: this applies to those FCs in which [ti] is preceded by [s] (e.g. those
derived from κέκασμαι, 7.5, including Καστιάνειρα, 8.5).

  Conclusion – V1 Formations and the system of verbal compounds in Ancient Greek        351
      Both the make-up of Mycenaean compounds in -ti- and the related ques-
tion of the dynamics of assibilation in Mycenaean benefit from the hypothesis,
advanced in section 5, that -ti- compounds and -si- compounds are independent
of one another, with the latter attested only in AG (starting with Mycenaean: see
ta-si-ko-no in section 7.9). We submitted that from the start these FCs in -si- were
formed by employing the stem of the sigmatic aorist: the origin of this type of
FC, therefore, is not to be sought in the assibilation of FCs in -ti-. Aside from the
lack of evidence for comparable compounds in -si- from the other IE languages of
early attestation, there are no particularly strong arguments against the hypoth-
esis that V1 compounds derived from the s-aorist in a chronologically late phase
of IE (section 6.1). In AG, this derivational process was further encouraged by the
independent phenomenon of assibilation, which arguably transformed many old
-ti- compounds into -si- compounds in the linguistic stage immediately following
Mycenaean Greek. The characteristic -si- element—in which -s- marks derivation
from the s-aorist (as well as the future) and -i- is merely a linking vowel—attained
huge popularity in the Greek compound system, since it encouraged the inclu-
sion of V1 compounds in a derivational cycle which also contained the future
and action nouns in -σις. This is the factor behind the much higher productivity
of τερψίμβροτος compounds over the φερέοικος type (section 4.2).4 In positing a
system in which compound FCs were derived from verbal roots and stems, often
in association with specific verbal formations, Chapter 4 rejected the hypothesis
that these FCs also expressed aspect: such a hypothesis is unverifiable as far as
the parent language is concerned and AG does not provide any evidence for the
existence of aspectual nuances in V1 compounds.
      After assuming this historical perspective, the book has focused on the
synchronic study of AG V1 compounds, developing a methodological approach
based on comparing them with V2 compounds. Unlike previous attempts of this
kind, the analysis provided is based on a full database of V1 compounds which
also provides information on competing V2 structures. The guiding principle
behind the contrastive analysis of V1 and V2 compounds has not been the desire
to understand the semantic and stylistic dynamics governing the choice of one
pattern over the other: indeed, the identification of these factors has been the
primary concern of all previous contributions which have dealt with the relation-
ship between these forms, from Andriotis (1938) to Benveniste (1967). By con-
trast, the approach adopted in this book envisages morphology and its rules as
the dominant factor behind the choice of V1 and V2 patterns. Our contention has
been that, in order to understand these morphological rules and the constraints
which follow from them, we must first understand the history of the verbs which

produce these compounds, and secondly the mechanisms that determine the der-
ivation of verbal simplicia and compounds from them.
     Our investigation has therefore endeavoured to develop a model of morpho-
logical analysis in which the study of V1 compounds is not separated from the
study of agent nouns in -ος, -τηρ, -τωρ and -της, which form the basis of the
majority of V2 compounds. Besides the mainstream types of agentive V2 com-
pounds in -ος and -της, this book has also addressed the behaviour of other types
of V2 compounds which are capable at times of fulfilling the same function as V1
formations: from the rare class of root compounds (Chapter 2, section 6.1) to the
more common verbal adjectives in -ής, which acquired an active meaning over
the course of the Classical age.
     The synchronic survey provided in the last two chapters of this book,
however, also took account of the stylistic factors which influenced the success
of many compound families, as well as the semantic re-interpretations that
they were sometimes subjected to. It is precisely the study of V1 compounds in
context which often provides evidence for the hypothesis that the creation of a
large number of V1 compounds came about independently of stylistic concerns
and was instead influenced by various well-defined morphological factors and
constraints. An example of a tendency ruled by morphology is the fact that V1
compounds derived from verbs producing V2 compounds in -ος are less produc-
tive than V1 compounds derived from verbs which do not produce V2 compounds
in -ος. A large number of verbs which do not produce -ος agentive forms are also
lacking in other agent nouns: in this case, the creation of V1 compounds (ruled
by morphology) is responsible for the preservation of the V1 type in Greek and its
usage in a large number of contexts.
     Almost half of AG V1 compounds exist in isolation from V2 formations, and
the productivity, contextual use and semantics of these verbs is closely bound
up with those of the simple agent nouns derived from the same verbs. Chapter
5 addressed the question of whether there are any morphological factors which
impede the creation of V2 compounds and agent nouns from a given verb. The
verbs in Class I share a number of morphological properties, the most conspic-
uous of which is that they are neither based on CeC/CoC ablauting roots nor
do they belong to the category of ‘Greek presents in short vowel’: the lack of V2
compounds derived from them can therefore be attributed, first and foremost, to
their inability to create -ος agent nouns. The V1 compounds produced by these
verbs also tend to be isolated forms and an investigation of the base verbs and
their compounds has made it possible to link this low productivity to semantic
and stylistic factors, which certainly also contributed to the lack of agent nouns
and compounds. Among these factors, special attention has been paid to the
poetic specialization of some base verbs (e.g. ἀμέρδω, ἀμεύομαι, εἰλέω) and the

competition which others faced from more popular synonyms (e.g. ἀγαπάω and
στυγέω).
      Even in Class II the majority of verbs are not based on CeC/CoC roots and the
presents in short vowel are similarly very few. However, the verbs in this class as
a whole produce a substantial number of agent nouns in -της, which in principle
are free to compound. The fact that these thirty-three verbs do not seem to have
produced V2 compounds cannot be ascribed only to the vagaries of our sources:
the analysis of agent nouns carried out in sections 5.1–5.1.4 suggested that the low
productivity and late attestation of many of these simplicia, combined with the
clear semantic specialization of others, is responsible for the lack of V2 forma-
tions. The high number of V1 compounds derived from the three verbs in Class
III too is assuredly connected to the semantic limitations of their V2 counterparts
(which are all intransitive or passive). In Classes I–III, therefore, recourse is made
to the V1 type whenever the V2 pattern cannot be formed or is unavailable. The
productivity of these V1 compounds is reasonably high in both the appellative
and the onomastic domains, a fact which confirms that the function which they
fulfilled was—on some level at least—a central one.
      In Chapter 6 the focus shifted to competing pairs of V1/V2 compounds, and
the individual morphological factors at play in the success of either pattern came
under scrutiny. As just noted, V1 compounds corresponding to V2 compounds
in -ος tend to be more marginal, and are sometimes limited to onomastics. Con-
versely, V2 compounds in -της are not always very productive and in a number
of specific cases the deficiencies of the V2 structure are compensated for by a
productive V1 type. In section 3.2.1 we also noted that V1 compounds may be a
stronger competitor for V2 compounds in -της because the semantic sphere of
V1 forms is ampler, in that they can be used as adjectives (whereas -της forms
cannot). At the same time, the language may seek to develop alternative types
of right-oriented compounds: section 4.2.1 concluded that most of the seventeen
families of active compounds in -ής were probably developed to complement V1
types of a mostly onomastic nature. What we appear to have in this case, there-
fore, is a neat distribution of structures, as well as an exceptional acquisition
of active semantics on the part of -ής compounds in order to make up for the
deficiencies of the V1 structure. As noted in section 4.3, however, these active
-ής compounds never become wholesale substitutes for other V2 types and they
do not intervene to provide the V1 compounds of Classes I–III with a productive
V2 counterpart. This confirms that the primary function of active compounds in
-ής was a different one, namely the expression of intransitivity (section 4.3). The
impact of determinative compounds of the ἀστυάναξ type (section 5) is similarly
very restricted, but their analysis is useful for refining our understanding of the
Greek trend towards right-oriented endocentric formations.

354        Conclusion – V1 Formations and the system of verbal compounds in Ancient Greek
     Especially in the comparison of V1 compounds with common V2 compounds,
discussion of style and literary contexts complemented the morphological
analysis. It is often the case that the V2 compounds derived from a given verb
are attested in all linguistic registers and therefore also in ‘common’ Greek: an
example is ἐλάω, discussed in Chapter 6. In these cases, V1 compounds tend to
be marked as being either more high-level (e.g. those derived from ἐλάω itself,
κλέπτω and στρέφω) or even poetic (see particularly βόσκω with βωτιάνειρα), or
limited to onomastics (e.g. ἡγέομαι, ἵστημι). We must be attentive to such register
variations in the use of compound patterns, but we must also be wary of attrib-
uting the specific characteristics and tendencies of individual types/families to
the whole V1 category as if they represented general rules of behaviour. V2 com-
pounds are by no means uniquely ‘low level’, being in fact represented across all
literary and epigraphic genres. It was noted in Chapter 6, for instance, that the
very prevalent type of V2 compounds derived from φέρω is far from being con-
fined to more ‘standard’ linguistic levels compared to the corresponding V1 type:
both structures have a similar distribution.
     What tends to be more predictable, however, is the onomastic specialization
of V1 forms that are in competition with common V2 compounds. Such onomastic
specialization also applies to a number of the V1 families discussed in Chapter 5,
in which case the lack of V2 counterparts of course means that the presence of the
V1 orientation cannot be ascribed to such competition. This certainly shows that
V1 compounds were one of the types most frequently selected for PNs. At the same
time, the exclusive onomastic specialization of certain families may have more to
do with the meanings of the base verbs and their popularity in onomastics than
with the V1 pattern as a whole. When we combine our the data for exclusively
onomastic V1 compounds (from all four classes) with our data for V1 families
confined to literary language, however, it becomes clear that V1 compounds are a
widely exploited compound type rather than a scarcely productive relic.
     Of course, both the Corpus and any conclusions derived from it are inevitably
going to have a degree of uncertainty associated with them: we know AG mostly
from literary or highly standardized epigraphic texts, and this has certainly meant
the obliteration of a large number of forms that would have belonged to the oral
language. Particularly in connection with the conclusions reached in Chapter 5,
since V1 compounds without V2 counterparts were under discussion there, we
should bear in mind that the lack of a given form could very easily be due to
poor documentation or to the fact that a particular form was not appropriate to
the specific socio-linguistic variety represented by the texts we have. That said,
many of our results concerning the lack of V2 forms and/or agent nouns derived
from a given verb have turned out to be supported by the general behavior of the

  Conclusion – V1 Formations and the system of verbal compounds in Ancient Greek        355
relevant base verbs, which often seem to be rare or an unproductive source of
derivatives (for examples of this, see Chapter 5, section 4.1).
     Comprehensive data collecting and in-depth analysis of individual com-
pound families and their base verbs, combined with the study of the contexts
and registers in which V1 compounds are used, have offered new insights into
the structure of V1 compounds and improved our understanding of their develop-
ment within the AG compound system. The productivity of V1 compounds:
1. is very often connected to that of the base verb (Chapter 5, for instance, exam-
     ined the low productivity of many V1 families derived from exclusively poetic
     archaic verbs);
2. is explainable on the basis of the base verb’s behaviour in certain registers/
     types of texts (e.g. in Chapter 6 this was noted apropos of the specialization
     of κάμπτω in musical terminology);
3. is influenced by the chronological distribution of the corresponding agent
     nouns and V2 forms (in Chapter 6 we noted, for instance, the late rise and
     semantic specialization of V2 compounds in -κοσμητής, a fact which may
     explain the early productivity of the V1 type in κοσμησι-);
4. may be due to special semantic restrictions associated with the base verbs
     (as noted in relation to καλέω, τρέχω, and the agent nouns from πράσσω in
     Chapter 6).
Through the close study of V1 compounds, this book has also contributed to
clarifying the role of verbal compounds in the Greek compound system. Though
not without contradictions and ‘uneconomic’ phenomena, this is a very flex-
ible system as regards both the exploitation of those patterns allowed by the
morphology of each verbal root and their semantic specialization. Verbal roots
of the ablauting type tend, if possible, to give rise to V2 structures, both active
(κουροτρόφος type) and passive (ὀρεσ́τροφος type). Some of these verbal roots
also create productive V1 compounds. Roots which give rise to Greek verbs in
short vowel (e.g. ἄρχω) too tend to give rise to active V2 compounds in -ος. Other
verbal roots can form active V2 compounds by using compound agent nouns in
-της. Alongside these, and especially when -της compounds do not exist for a
given verb, the V1 pattern can prove another viable option.
     These active and largely agentive verbal compounds are accompanied by
passive verbal adjectives. In addition to those in -τoς (on their morphological
constraints see Chapter 2, section 6.7), Greek developed a new passive type in -ής.
Change of voice is common within some families of -ής compounds, and active or
even active-transitive compounds in -ής can be created out of previously passive
ones or immediately as such. However, this is also a limited phenomenon overall:

356         Conclusion – V1 Formations and the system of verbal compounds in Ancient Greek
active compounds in -ής never become a systematically productive type which
replaces other types of agentive compounds.
     The interaction between all the above-mentioned verbal compounds is far
from haphazard, since these formations are neatly distributed along a scale
combining transitivity and voice. Passive compounds in -τος—the prototypical
passive type, which Greek inherited from PIE—stand at one end of the spectrum,
while V1 compounds (whose SCs mostly fulfil the direct object function and are
therefore highly transitive) are at the other end.
                                                                               Passive
V2 -τος        ἄφερτος ‘intolerable’                      Passive
V1             φερέοικος ‘carrying the house’             Transitive
                                                                               Active
The other verbal formations discussed in this book are distributed between these
two extremes. Next to compounds in -τος, -ής compounds express passive seman-
tics (e.g. ἀνωφερής ‘borne upwards’), but also add the expression of active-in-
transitive semantics (e.g. οἰνοφερής ‘inclined to wine’), with transitivity being
a limited development in some defined families. They are followed by -ος com-
pounds, which include a passive type (ἀνώφορος ‘borne upwards’) and a very
productive active one, which can be either transitive (οἰκοφόρος ‘carrying the
house’) or intransitive (λαιψηροδρόμος ‘swift-running’). -της compounds, on the
other hand, are not passive (the odd passive semantics of certain compounds is
                                                                               Passive

agent, thus having a high degree of transitivity: these can accordingly be placed
closest to V1 compounds at the other end of the spectrum. Through the combina-

tion of these formations, Greek achieves a degree of semantic flexibility for the
expression of voice and thematic roles in compounding which is one of the most
striking characteristics of its sophisticated compound system.
     This system of verbal compounds requires a more detailed study, which
could delve into the impact of voice on the formal make-up of verbal compounds
and pay careful attention to the diachronic development of all verbal compound
categories and to their relation to one another. An investigation of AG verbal
compounds vis-à-vis phrases with finite verbs or participles would also be worth-
while, as would—on a much larger scale—a study of the factors determining the
use of a compound instead of a corresponding syntactic phrase. Some work in
this direction was described in Chapter 2, section 7.4 apropos of structures with
governing adjectives and their complement, or nouns and their specifying gen-
itive (section 7.3). All of these topics would naturally benefit from a diachronic
approach, tracing patterns of development all the way from Ancient Greek to the
medieval and modern varieties of the language: an investigation which I hope
others will embark upon.

Corpus of V1 Compounds, Their Base Verbs,

and V2 Compounds
Criteria of organization
1 Entries
The purpose of this collection is to provide a comprehensive corpus of V1 com-
pounds down to the 6th c. AD, with forays into the Byzantine period, and a sys-
tematic picture of their formal variations. Entries are organized according to the
verb from which the V1 compounds derive: these are mostly presents, but a few
thematic aorists have also been included. Each entry provides information on
the FC(s) of the V1 compounds, their first attestation, and a full list of appellative
and onomastic compounds. In some more numerous families, compounds may
be divided between literary and epigraphic attestations. This information is fol-
lowed by a list of the agent nouns produced by the same verb (if there are any)
and by a full list of active V2 compounds which are semantically comparable to V1
ones: chiefly those in -ος, -της, -τηρ/τωρ, as well as active V2 compounds in -ής.
2 Classification of verbs and their compounds
The following Roman numbers are used to refer to the classes of verbs and their
compounds studied in Chapters 5 and 6; these numbers follow the verb in each
entry:
I: V1 compounds from verbs which do not create agent nouns or V2 forms (ana-
lyzed in Chapter 5): forty-two verbs;
II: V1 compounds from verbs which create agent nouns but no V2 forms (analyzed
in Chapter 5): thirty-three verbs;
III: V1 compounds with a V2 counterpart from verbs which do not give rise to an
agent noun: three verbs;
IV: V1 compounds with V2 counterparts of the agentive type (in -ος or -της), ana-
lyzed in Chapter 6: fifty-eight verbs;
IVa: V1 compounds with only V2 counterparts in -ής (analyzed in Chapter 6): sev-
enteen verbs;

3 Meanings
Meanings are provided to orient the reader in the interpretation of compounds,
but should not be considered exhaustive: they usually follow LSJ or the first
meaning provided there, although for some forms a more literal rendering has
been preferred. Readers however should check the semantic range of each form
in the dictionary.
4 Inscriptions and personal names
Epigraphic compounds have been included, with dates, whenever possible. This
corpus is mostly based on available lexica and should not therefore be consid-
ered exhaustive. PNs are collected from the LGPN, unless otherwise indicated.
Forms whose belonging to a certain compound pattern is uncertain are followed
by ‘?’. Abbreviations used in epigraphic attestations follow those in the LGPN:
note in particular the use of ‘?’ preceding dates for dubious dating and following
place-names for dubious provenance. The list of PNs is meant to give an idea of
the use of a given FC in onomastics, rather than to provide a complete corpus
of forms: for this reason, formal and dialectal variants of individual names are
omitted (see Chapter 2, section 8.1). Names attested in inscriptions are arranged
in alphabetical order, while those attested in literary texts keep the chronological
order adopted for appellatives as well. In larger compound families, literary and
epigraphic compounds are listed in separate entries.
     The collection of PNs was completed before the publication of LGPN VA (Costal
Asia Minor: Pontos to Ionia, 2010) and VB (Costal Asia Minor: Caria to Cilicia, 2014):
consequently, names included in these volumes are not listed in this Corpus.
5 Mycenaean forms
Mycenaean V1 and V2 compounds are included, with a transliteration, whenever
they provide information for the dating of phenomena and the productivity of a
given compound type in Greek. However, not all the Mycenaean V1 PNs have been
included, particularly in the case of those which are lost or re-analysed in alpha-

names from * k ̑ens-).
6 Dialectal forms
[a:] (ᾱ) is always marked in forms which are not in Attic-Ionic, in accordance with
LSJ practice.
7 Dates
All dates are BC unless otherwise stated (BC is retained in years to avoid ambigu-
ity). The dating of forms mostly follows LSJ and the LGPN, unless when correc-
tions have been introduced. Appellative compounds are given in a roughly chron-
ological order, although the dating of certain literary authors is uncertain and
many Hellenistic inscriptions are notoriously difficult to date: ‘span-dates’ (e.g.
1st–2nd c.) and ‘period-dates’ (e.g. ‘hell.’ for ‘hellenistic’) used in the LGPN have
been retained. As noted, uncertain dates are preceded (without space) by ‘?’; ref-
erence to an uncertain period (e.g. ‘hell.’) are followed by ‘?’, as in the LGPN.
In the Corpus, compounds from the Orphic Hymns are listed among the words
from the period between the 2nd and 3rd c. AD, since the exact dating of these
poetic texts is uncertain.1

First attested compound: Αἱρήhιππος ‘taking horses’ (Laconia ca. 431–403).
Appellative compounds: αἱρησιτείχης ‘taker of walls’ (title of a play by Diphi-

Onomastic compounds: Αἱρίππη (Euboea 3rd c.).
Agent nouns: αἱρέτης ‘one who chooses’ (Vett. Val.; used also in the specialized
meaning of ‘searcher of archives’ in POxy. 1654.7, 2nd c. AD). An earlier form is
attested in the noun καθαιρέτης ‘overthrower’ derived from the compound verb
καθαιρέω ‘put down, destroy’.
V2 compounds: None.
ἀκέομαι ‘heal’ (II)
FC: ἀκε(σ)σι-
First attested compound:  ̓Ακέσανδρος ‘healing men’ (Cyprus 5th–4th c.).
Appellative compounds: ἀκεσσίπονος ‘healing toil’ (Nonn.).4
Onomastic compounds:  ̓Ακεσιγένης (Rhodes 70 BC),  ̓Ακεσίμβροτος (Rhodes

its meaning ‘system of philosophical principles, sect’ and the compound means ‘leader of a
philosophical school’.
4 ἀκεσσίνοσος ‘healing disease’ has been conjectured in AP 9.516.4 (Crinagoras) and is
included in LSJ.

Agent nouns: ἀκουστής ‘hearer’ (Men.).
V2 compounds: ὠτακουστής ‘eavesdropper’ (of a person employed as a spy;
Aristot.). The numerous compounds in -ήκοος are bahuvrihis, as shown by the
position of the accent and by the fact that the FC of these and similar compounds
always functions as a determination of the SC, never as its object.
ἀλγέω ‘grieve’ (IVa)

First attested compound: ἀλγεσίθυμος ‘grieving the heart’ (Orph. H.).
Appellative compounds: None.
Onomastic compounds: None (Ἄλγαλσος, Illyria 168 BC, is unclear).
Agent nouns: None.
V2 compounds: None. Some compounds in -αλγής, e.g. θυμαλγής ‘heart-griev-
ing’ (Hom.), may derive directly from the verb rather than from ἄλγος. Of these,
only θυμαλγής has the SC in the function of the direct object; the few other active
compounds have adverbial FCs, e.g. βαρυαλγής ‘grievously suffering’ (Orph. H.).
ἀλέξω ‘keep off, ward off, protect’ (II)

ἀλεξίμβροτος ‘protecting men’ (Pi.), ἀλεξαίθριος ‘screening from chill air’ (Soph.),
ἀλεξίμορος ‘warding off death’ (ibid.), ἀλεξίπονος ‘warding off pain’ (ibid.),

ἀλεξίγαμος ‘shunning marriage’ (Nonn.), ἀλεξιβέλεμνος ‘keeping off darts’ (Paul.
Sil.), ἀλεξίκηπος ‘protecting the garden’ (Geop.; title of a work on gardening by
Nestor).
(Ep.) ἀλεξίχορος ‘helping or favouring the chorus’ (IG 22.4533.35, Αttica 3rd c. AD).
5 This interpretation consciously leaves aside the question of whether Ἀλέξανδρος may have
had a non-Greek origin. Even if the foreign etymology were to be proven correct, it is likely that
the name was transformed into a meaningful Greek form and connected with the verb ἀλέξω.

Appellative compounds: ἀρτιεπής ‘he who fits together words; good at talking’

shift may have started already in Homeric Greek, where ἀρτίφρων ‘ready of mind’

Agent nouns: The adjective ὀχός ‘solid’ (hapax in Ph. Byz.) might represent
the continuation of an old agent noun meaning ‘holding together’. The same
semantics is shown by ὄχος ‘anything that holds’ (hapax in Hom.), whose accent
however is typical of action nouns. The PN Ἕκτωρ may represent an old agent
noun.
V2 compounds: a-ni-o-ko = ἡνίοχος ‘rein-holder, charioteer’, ko-to-no-o-ko

V2 compounds: Compounds in -θηλής (< -θᾱλής) and many of those in -θᾰλ(λ)ής
are likely to derive from the verb: ἐριθηλής ‘very flourishing’ (Hom.), νεοθηλής
‘fresh-budding’ (ibid.), πανθηλής ‘all-blossoming’ (Bacch.), δυσθᾰλής ‘hardly
growing’ (Cratin.), ἰοθᾱλής ‘blooming with violets’ (Philox.), ὀρειθᾰλής ‘bloom-
ing on the hills’ (Lycophr.), ἀειθᾰλής ‘evergreen’ (Mel.), χοροιθᾰλής ‘flourish-

as we can see from the preverbed forms ἀφέτης ‘one who lets off a military engine’
(Plb.; also attested with other meanings) and ἀφετήρ ‘starting point’ (Iambl.).
These are compounded into determinative formations: see e.g. Σαλαμιναφέτης

408          Appendix
Agent nouns: ῥήκτης ‘breaker’ (Aristot.).
V2 compounds: None of the agentive type. There are two 5th-century compounds
in -ρραγής with active meaning, αἱμορραγής ‘bleeding’ (Soph.) and ψυχορραγής
‘letting the soul break loose’ (Eur.), but the type remains overwhelmingly passive
throughout.
ῥίπτω ‘throw, hurl’ (I)
FC: ῥιψι-
First attested compound: ῥιψαύχην ‘tossing the neck’ (Pi.).
Appellative compounds: ῥίψοπλος ‘throwing away one’s weapons’ (said

ῥιψόφθαλμος ‘casting the eyes about’ (Ptol.).
Onomastic compounds: Ῥιψόλᾱος (Sparta 624 BC).

ica anonyma 3.350 Walz).
σπένδω ‘pour, make a drink offering’ (I)
FC: σπενσι-, σπενδε-?
First attested compound: Σπενσίθεος ‘one who makes offerings to the gods’
(Crete ca. 500 BC). If the etymology is correct, the FC would seem to be formed
on the original stem of the s-aorist σπεν-σ-, with a phonological treatment only
reserved to secondary [ns] sequences in Cretan.
Onomastic compounds: the FC σπενδε- may lie behind the Kurzname Σπένδων
(Thebes ca. 316–250), which however is interpretable also as a participle.
Agent nouns: None.
V2 compounds: None. Compounds in -σπονδος are bahuvrihis containining
σπονδή: e.g. τρίσπονδος ‘consisting of three pourings’ (Soph.), οἰνόσπονδος ‘with
11 Paliuri (2014: 55).

First attested compound: Στελλανδρίδης (Thasos 5th–4th c.).
Agent nouns: None.
V2 compounds: Although most of the frequent compounds in -στολος are bahu-
vrihis from στόλος ‘equipment’ or στολή ‘expedition’, the following forms have
a probably V2 agentive structure: πυγοστόλος, literally ‘fitting out, decorating
her buttocks’ (Hes.), and by γαμοστόλος ‘preparing a wedding’ (attributed to
Pisander by schol. Eur.), πομποστολέω ‘conduct a procession’ (IG 2.1325, Athens,
174–173), νεκυοστόλος ‘ferrying the dead’ (Antip. Thess.), νυμφοστόλος ‘escort-
ing the bride’ (Jos.), νεκροστόλος ‘layer-out of corpses’ (Artem.), φορτοστόλος
‘sending off a freight’ (Man.), ψυχοστόλος ‘escorting souls’ (Tryph.).
στέργω ‘love’ (IVa)
FC: στεργ-
First attested compound: ἀστεργάνωρ ‘not loving men’ (i.e. ‘not having loved
men’, said of Io who was loved by Zeus, Aesch.) is a poetic formation likely to be
based on the unattested **στεργάνωρ.
Other compounds: στεργοξύνευνος ‘loving one’s consort’ (Lycophr.).
Agent nouns: None.
V2 compounds: One of the few compounds in -στεργής, ἀστεργής ‘not loving’,
has an active meaning in Soph. Aj. 776, while it is passive in Soph. OT 229. Two
other late compounds have active meaning: τεκνοστοργής ‘full of filial affection’
(Sidyma, TAM 2.235) and ὁμόστοργος ‘feeling the same affection’ (Nonn.).

First attested compound: στρεφεδινέω ‘whirl round the stream’ (Hom.), seem-

analysis of this artificial compound, see Chapter 6, section 3.1), στρεψοδικέω

‘enduring (many) trials’ (ibid.), ταλαπενθής ‘bearing grief’ (ibid.), ταλαύρινος
‘bearing a shield of a bull’s hide’ (ibid.), ταλαίπωρος ‘miserable’ (lit. ‘bearing
stones’). Other forms do not have a governing meaning. For instance, ταλάφρων,
ταλακάρδιος, τλήθυμος and τλησικάρδιος (Aesch.) all mean ‘patient of mind’: the
FC conveys a kind of adjectival idea and is probably influenced by the adjective
τάλας.
Onomastic compounds: Τλήθυμος (Athens 367/6), Τλησίβιος (Euboea 5th c.),
Τλησίμαχος (Boeotia 431–404), Τλησιμένης (Athens 464 BC).
Agent nouns: There are no agent nouns, but the transitive semantics of the verb
is expressed by τλήμων ‘patient’.
V2 compounds: The compounded forms of τλήμων all show quasi-adverbial FCs
e.g. πολυτλήμων ‘much-enduring’ (Hom.), δυστλήμων ‘suffering hard things’ (H.
Hom. Ap.), εὐτλήμων ‘much-enduring’ (Aesch.). A similar restriction concerns
compounds in -τλας and -τάλας e.g. πολύτλας ‘much-enduring’ (Hom.), Ἄτλας

V2 compounds: Compounds in -τροφος are very numerous, and many have a

infants’ and τεκνοτρεφής ‘rearing children’ (both Theod. St.).
τρέχω ‘run’ (IV)
FC: τρεχε-
First attested compound: τρεχέδειπνος ‘running to dinner’ (Posidipp.).
Other compounds: None.
Agent nouns: τροχός ‘wheel’ (Hom.); also ‘running’ (Pi.).
V2 compounds: All the compounds in -τροχος are either passive or compounded
with τροχός ‘wheel’; the only agentive compound seems to be ἁλίτροχος ‘running
through the sea’ (Ibyc.). The meaning ‘run’ is covered by the suppletive root
yielding V2 compounds in -δρομος. These are often compound forms of δρόμος

‘race’ or display passive semantics. Active forms tend to have adjectival or adver-
bial FCs, undoubtedly because of the intransitive semantics of the verb. Among
the Classical forms, see ἀνυόδρομος ‘swiftly-running’ (Sapph.), αἰθεροδρόμος
‘ether-skimming’ (Cinesias, quoted by Aristophanes), βοηδρόμος ‘running to

V2 compounds: Bahuvrihis in -φαής from φάος ‘light’ soon take on the meaning

/klāwiphoros/ ‘key-bearer’, te-o-po-ri-ja /theophhoriā/ ‘sacred ceremony’, βουληφό-
ρος ‘bringing advice’ (Hom.). Compounds in -φορος are the most numerous V2
compounds in Greek. A full list is available in Buck-Petersen 332–336. Because
of the great number of forms, this list—differently from all others—contains only
forms found in Homer: ἰσοφόρος ‘bearing equal weights’, λαοφόρος ‘bearing
people’, τοξοφόρος ‘bow-bearing’, πυρηφόρος ‘wheat-bearing’, τελεσφόρος
‘bringing fulfilment’. There also are a few compounds in -φερής which, however,
are mostly compounded with prepositions; see παμφερής ‘all-bearing’ (Gal.).

4th–3rd c.), Φευγόλιμος (Eretria 4th–3rd c.).
Agent nouns: None with the traditional agentive suffixes, but the semantics of
the agent noun is conveyed by φυγάς ‘one who flees’ which however is special-
ised to indicate a fugitive fleeing one’s country.
V2 compounds: only ὀψίφυγος ‘fleeing late’ (Hdn.).

First attested compound: pi-ro-wo-na /Philowoinā/ (= Φίλοινος ‘one who loves

Onomastic compounds: There are no PNs in φιλησι-, but the online LGPN lists
262 individual forms in Φιλο-, which are not repeated here for space constraints.
Among the most common of the transparent forms, see Φιλοδέσποτος ‘he who
loves his master’ (Herculaneum 1st c. BC–1st c. AD, a slave’s name), Φιλόδημος

Appellative compounds: φιλησίμολπος ‘loving song’ (Pi.). Appellative com-
pounds in φιλο-, which start off in Homer (φιλοπτόλεμος ‘loving war’), are
extremely productive at every stage of the Greek language. A full list of such
forms can be found in LSJ. On their role in the creation of other V1 compounds,
see Chapter 4, section 3.1. For their analysis within the V1/V2 competition, see
Chapter 6, section 3.1.
Agent nouns: The proper morphological agent noun is φιλητής ‘lover’, attested
late in Macedonius of Thessalonica.
V2 compounds: None in -φιλητής. The competing right-oriented compounds are
those in -φιλος, -φίλης and -φιλής. Forms showing active semantics of the SC are:
παιδόφιλος ‘lover of children, loving children’ (Sapph.), γυναικοφίλᾱς ‘lover of
women’ (Polyz.), λογοφίλης ‘fond of words’ (Philo) and λογόφιλος ‘fond of argu-
ment’ (Zeno Stoic.), πορνοφίλης ‘fond of prostitutes’ (Nicarchus?), ἐρημοφίλης
‘loving solitude’ (Paul. Sil.), γραόφιλος ‘lover of old women’ (schol. Aristoph.).
φλέγω ‘burn’ (IVa)

First attested compound: καταφλεξίπολις ‘inflamming cities’ (AP 5.1).14

Agent nouns: None.
V2 compounds: Among the few compounds in -φλεγής there are some active-in-
transitive ones: ζαφλεγής ‘full of fire’ (Hom.), ὁμοφλεγής ‘burning together’
(Nonn.), αἐιφλεγής ‘always burning’ (Greg. Naz.). From the structural point of
view these are not real counterparts of V1 compounds in that their FC is never a
noun. Compounds in -φλογος are always either bahuvrihis (e.g. ἄφλογος ‘without
flame in it’).

horror of water’ (Arr.), θεόφοβος ‘fearing God’ (Porph.).

about splinters, quibbles’, Agath.) and a few active compounds in -φραδ́ς.
φύω ‘produce’ (IV)

First attested compound: φυσίζοος ‘producing life’ (Hom.).
Other compounds: None.
Agent nouns: φύτωρ ‘begetter’ (Hsch.).
V2 compounds: πτεροφύτωρ ‘feather-producing’ (Pl.), ἀμπελοφύτωρ ‘wine-
planter’ (Leon.). However, the most common type of compounds are those in
-φυής, which start off as bahuvrihis of φυή (see e.g. ἀφυής ‘without natural
talent’, Democr., or τριφυής ‘with three stems’, Thphr.) but later also take on a
verbal meaning: see the full list in Buck-Petersen 731–732. The following Classi-
cal forms show active semantics: πτεροφυής ‘growing feathers or wings’ (Pl.),
ῥιζοφυής ‘growing out roots’ (Thphr.).
